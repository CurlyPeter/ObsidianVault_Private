"manifold A mathematical concept describing a reduced dimensional space existing in a higher-dimensional space. For example, a wavy, two-dimensional sheet in three dimensions is a manifold. It is believed, with good reason, that most complex datasets exist primarily on a manifold in the high-dimensional space in which the dataset is presented to models."
