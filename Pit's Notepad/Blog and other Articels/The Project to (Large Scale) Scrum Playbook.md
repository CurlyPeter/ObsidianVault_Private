### The Project to (Large Scale) Scrum Playbook

#### A guide for the use of Scrum and LeSS in or for projects

The demands for agility in projects are increasing more and more because the general conditions such as customer requirements, technological progress and society are changing at ever shorter intervals. Scrum has therefore become an essential part of everyday project work in companies. It is not unusual for a project to require several teams and Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) is the consequent choice. However, anyone who uses Scrum or LeSS in practice often notices that they contradict existing project management methods.

The guideline presented here helps to make decisions at the right time whether and how Scrum or LeSS should be used for projects in the organization. In doing so, the advantages resulting from the product mindset of Scrum and LeSS can be better utilized. On the other hand, the project portfolio can be retained for the time being as a control instrument for investing in innovation and improving the company’s value creation. And under certain circumstances, it makes sense to start a new project and use Scrum and later perhaps LeSS as the project structure.

All decisions of the playbook are shown in the following image. All turn-offs after each decision are numbered and can be found in brackets in the text.

### Project vs. Product

_„A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.“_  This is the definition of a project according to the Project Management Institute (PMI). A project therefore has a fixed time frame in which investments are made to achieve a result, e.g. an improvement in the production process or a software system. This is a significant difference to a product. The lifetime of a product is not fixed. In fact, we as a company are constantly investing in the product. Primarily with the work of our employees or other resources. Even if we want to get rid of the product once, we have to invest. If the lifespan of a product has been defined in advance, it is ultimately the last user of the product who determines when a product no longer exists. Perhaps the employee of a waste disposal company.

Products are therefore significantly larger in scope than projects and the targeted performance is anything but linear and also difficult to predict. The blue curve in the next image should therefore only be seen as an idealized and mostlikly desirable curve. From a company’s perspective, a project is an investment in the product for a certain period of time (red box in the image). Scrum is a framework that is helping to optimize the value generated for this investment. Scrum can be understood as a sequence of projects with a fixed period of one sprint (green boxes in the image). Scrum thus generates knowledge about how the next investment in the product can be improved at often much shorter intervals as before. In extreme cases, this knowledge can stop the investment in the product completely at an early stage. So how should you handle a new project if you want to think in terms of product development right from the start?

### Decision #1: Simple, complicated or complex?

#### (1) Short project duration, complicated undertaking.

In many companies, there are projects that are smaller than a sprint. This means that they are completed within 4 weeks or less. For example, the customer projects of a web agency. Setting up a separate Scrum team for each of these projects, or rather customer orders, would take too much time and effort to build up the team. Instead, it is advisable to include the customer order as a product backlog entry and a Scrum team plans the entry in one of the next sprints. The team can then optimize its work with the customer so that waiting times are minimized and a customer order can be completed within a sprint. This increases added value and flexibility for both the customer and the web agency.

Some of the web agency’s client assignments may stretch over 2–3 sprints. Nevertheless, the amount of work is relatively small, and the complexity is well understood. However, there are always waiting periods because decisions have not yet been made by the customer, the customer’s work packages have not yet been completed or things are only to be delivered on a certain date. The picture below shows the customer projects of a software company on a Kanban system. The backlog entries for training by the support team, customization of the standard software by the software team and provision of the infrastructure were created by the team members and scheduled accordingly in the teams’ backlogs.

(3) At this stage, you may not have a real Scrum team in the company at all. To start with, you should first ask, what is the product that the employees are working on? To find an answer, it helps to look at the meaning of the term “product”:

> “The product is the result of work”.

In the context of a company, a definition like the one we find in the Scrum Guide certainly fits better:

> “A product is a means of creating value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders and clearly defined users or customers. A product can be a service, a physical product or something more abstract.”

In the case of the web agency, the product could therefore be: “Service for the development of web offerings”. The scope or limits of the product must therefore be set particularly broadly. Already, a Scrum team can be formed for this service, which maximizes the value of the product with each sprint in a self-managed way. It is then also clear that in the case of the web agency, the product owner role is provided by the web agency itself and not by the customer. This is because the agency owns the service and bears the associated obligations. An essential task of the Product Owner role is to evaluate the customer orders according to an internal customer ranking and to position them in the Product Backlog. Even if each item is only complicated, operating and improving this service as a whole can be very complex.

There are projects whose context is very well understood and are constantly in the complex domain. For example, customer projects at a prefabricated house manufacturer. Here, they rely on serial production to reduce unit costs and to scale. The fewer variants you allow in the houses, the lower the complexity. The greater the potential for mass scaling, of course. The team or teams primarily consider the result of the production and construction as their product. In other words, the customer’s completed houses. They derive the necessary optimizations from the experience gained from customer projects and take these into account in their product backlog. To do this, planners, manufacturers, fitters and craftsmen in the teams must of course work together and break down these improvements into suitable product backlog entries. For example, one team can advance the further development of the smart home control system, while another team deals with the automation of series production and a third team takes care of semi-automated order planning and processing. I recommend using  [Wardley Mapping](https://medium.com/@swardley)  to identify suitable team and product split.

#### (2) Complexity and need for innovation is high

The majority of projects in companies usually have a significantly longer duration than 2–3 sprints. A longer duration is an indicator of higher complexity. Complex means that many unknown factors will influence the project that cannot be predicted at the start of the project. This is not a failure of the project team, but is simply the nature of projects and product development. One factor is the constantly changing requirements. Another is technical realization because many solutions are uncharted territory. Very innovative projects are characterized by the fact that we only work with very vague assumptions for both factors. We can’t even say how many changes we will have and in what quality. It is in the nature of things that it is difficult to determine the degree of complexity. As a simple guiding principle, we can state: if the question whether the project is complicated or complex needs to be discussed. Then it is most likely complex. David Snowden’s  [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework)  can provide guidance here.

### Decision #2: Does the WIP limit for active projects allow you to start a new project?

So far, we have brought the project to the team or teams. The advantage is obvious. We don’t have to invest in setting up a new team. The employees are also grateful because they don’t have to constantly reorganize themselves and can focus on results. The work more likely in a flow state, and we are talking about real, effective teams.

However, if our project is complex and our demand for innovation is high, we come to the standard case for Scrum. This is actually the birth of every Scrum environment, as described by  [Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game). We look for the right talents to form an initial, new team. A Scrum Master takes care of building the team. A manager with decision-making powers takes on the role of Product Owner. This team, which is as autonomous as possible, can now question existing rules and develop entirely new approaches to solving the problem. To a certain extent, we can see such a team as a start-up within the company. Some companies even go down the path of funding a real start-up.

(4) But beware, many companies fall into a trap here. Too many projects are started at the same time. There are companies whose number of active projects is greater than the number of employees. A complex project does not just affect one team. Often several teams are involved and the work of the entire organization is affected. The project team or teams are therefore anything but autonomous. It is difficult to predict how many parallel projects a company can carry out without causing a traffic jam or a complete blockage in the work system. However, it is safe to say: fewer than one might first assume. The fewer the number of active projects, the higher the lead time. This generates value and feedback earlier, which in turn benefits the next projects.

(5) So before starting the next project team — with or without Scrum — it is essential to check that the maximum reasonable number of active projects is not exceeded. To achieve this, the project must be weighted against all other projects. If these are organized with Scrum, then the product increment and the experience of the team(s) providing the best possible data for the decision makers. A positive result of this step can therefore be, to cancel an active project in favor of a new, more attractive project. It makes no sense to throw good money after a bad investment.

A project can therefore be considered an entry in a company’s project backlog. Many companies often no longer use the term project at this flight level. Personally, I prefer the term innovation goal. Because that’s what we want to do. We intend to innovate with our product and set ourselves a goal. In any case, a project profile that outlines the most important parameters for the project is sufficient. With the goals or profiles as entries, you can organize the project backlog as a Kanban system and make the flow from concept to cash transparent. With such a system, you can also explore how high the maximum parallel project load can be, by experimenting with a work-in-progress limit (WIP-limit) for projects.

The picture below shows such a Kanban system after an initial workshop. It shows all known projects in the Pipeline. Some projects have a volume of more than 10 million € and an estimated project duration of more than 2 years. The workshop participants quickly agreed that the pipeline was blocked.

### Decision #3: Continue the project as product development

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*d4QPgZ4-6MElfYw5)

(6) Mit der Bezeichnung “Idealisierte, angestrebte ROI-Entwicklung des Produktes” für die blaue Kurve im Bild, kann man schon erahnen. Die Realität wird eine andere sein. Was auch immer das Innovationsziel war, die Kosten sind wahrscheinlich höher als erwartet. Scrum spielt jetzt seine volle Stärke aus, den gemäß den Prinzipien des agilen Manifests, wird der Fortschritt am fertigen Produkt Increment gemessen. Es ist der beste Datenlieferant, um Zukunftsaussagen zu treffen. Mit jedem Sprint erhält man mehr Informationen. Meist schon nach 3, spätestens nach 9 Sprints, lässt sich eine Aussage treffen, ob mit der neuen Produktentwicklung, die mit dem Projekt gestattet wurde, fortgeführt werden soll. Jetzt sollte man frühzeitig folgende Punkte beachten:

1.  Das Team stabilisieren und nicht unnötig vergrößern. Viel zu oft wird für jedes neue Problem ein neuer Mitarbeiter eingestellt. Wichtiger ist, die soziale Komplexität für die Teammitglieder klein zu halten. Vielleicht wurden externe Kräfte hinzugezogen und man sollte sich jetzt die Talente dauerhaft sichern. Möglicherweise wird das Projektteam zu einer neuen Organisationseinheit.
2.  Der Produkt Owner sollte jetzt besonders auf die nicht-funktionalen Eigenschaften oder Aspekte des Produktes achten und das Team somit auf technische Exzellenz und eine solide Systemarchitektur fokussieren. Den wichtiger als Mitarbeitern im Arbeitssystem zu skalieren, ist es, das Produkt im Markt skalieren zu können. Z.B. Sollten die Teams durch Experimente nachweisen können, wie sie den angestrebten, exponentiellen Nutzerzuwachs sicherstellen wollen? Oder welche Architektur braucht es, um stetig neue Features liefern zu können?
3.  Wächst das Produktteam auf über 10–12 Personen, sollte der ScrumMaster einen schlanken Rahmen zum Skalieren wählen. Wenn man es geschickt macht, dann wird sich von selbst eine Skalierung nach LeSS ergeben.

(7) Wie schon zuvor erwähnt. Ein Gewinn kann die vorzeitige Erkenntnis sein, dass das neue Produkt und damit das Projekt nach aktueller Kenntnislage kein Erfolg wird oder im Vergleich zu anderen Vorhaben weniger Erfolg verspricht. Jetzt wird klar, wie wichtig ein Product Owner ist, der tatsächlich Ownership übernimmt. Er muss dafür Sorge tragen, dass die Weiterentwicklung des Produktes beendet und damit das Projekt vorzeitig gestoppt wird. So macht er den Weg frei für ein Projekt, welches mehr Chancen für das Unternehmen eröffnen kann.

### Ausblick: Auf LeSS und LeSS-Huge umstellen

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*uF2SruSTmhXnlL0x)

Nun, da das Projekt ein Erfolg versprechendes Produkt erzeugt und ein neues, Scrum-basierte Arbeitssystem erprobt wurde, stellt sich die Frage, ob und wie wir dies für die gesamte Organisation nutzen können.

(8) Möglicherweise kann unsere neu geschaffene Projektorganisation gänzlich unabhängig von allen anderen Teilen der Organisation arbeiten. Es spricht dann vieles dafür, die Organisationseinheit als solche bestehen zu lassen.

(9) Arbeiten allerdings andere Teams auch an gleichen oder verknüpften Produkten, ist es sinnvoller, das neue Know-how zu nutzen und in eine gesamte Projektorganisation einzubringen. Das bedeutet natürlich Umlernen für alle Beteiligten und geht mit einer Reorganisation der Teams und der beteligten Organisationseinheiten daher. Auch hier gibt LeSS und LeSS-Huge klare Leitlinien. Am Ende wird das vom Projekt geschaffene Teilprodukt von allen Teams weiterentwickelt. Eine solche Organisation spricht dann auch nicht mehr von Projekten, sondern wie oben erwähnt, von Zielen (Perfektion-Goal, Innovationsziel, etc). Das ist besonders dann sehr sinnvoll für das Unternehmen, wenn die Weiterentwicklung für das Teilprodukt in die Stabilisierung eintritt. Wir also nur noch ein Interesse daran haben, dass die Kunden weiterhin ihren Wert erzeugen können, wir aber keine Innovation und damit massive Wertzuwächse erwarten. Eine LeSS oder LeSS-Huge Umgebung fällt es deutlich leichter, die vorhandenen Teams auf neue Innovationsziele (ehemals Projekte genannt) zu fokussieren.
