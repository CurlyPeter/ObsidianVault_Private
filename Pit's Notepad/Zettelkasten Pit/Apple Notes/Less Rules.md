<span style="color:#252626ff;">Wording. Same as Scrum Guide Definition</span>
<span style="color:#252626ff;">There are some gaps in the wording in comparison to the Scrum Guide. I think as closer the less definition is to the scrum guide as better can we reference to Scrum.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Scrum Team	Product Group</span>	 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Development Team	Team</span>	 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Sprint Planning (Part 1: What)	Sprint Planning 1</span>	 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Sprint Planning (Part 2: How)	Sprint Planning 2</span>	 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Increment</span>
