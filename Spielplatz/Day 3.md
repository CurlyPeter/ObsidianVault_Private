# Vision and Stakeholder Collaboration
## Vision lives in minds; keep recalibrating with the people
- A product vision is co-created and continuously clarified with stakeholders, not a single slide.
- The Product Owner should keep discussing the vision with the team and stakeholders to verify understanding and adjust based on feedback.
- Use a toolkit beyond slides (vision boards, Lean Canvas, press releases, vision boxes) to surface assumptions and align on direction.
- Surface and validate how different groups interpret the vision by asking them to restate it in their own words.
- Be prepared to iterate across formats (e.g., vision board, vision box, press release) to maintain alignment.
- Beware misinterpretations (e.g., oil tanker vs speedboat analogy) and reinforce the intended meaning through repeated沟通.
- Involve a mix of stakeholders and team members to deepen understanding and buy-in.

# Product Backlog Refinement Fundamentals
## Refinement is ongoing, not a one-off task
- Refinement should happen continually and be treated as organizing the backlog, not turning items into granular tasks.
- Use a three-step approach: map items by size and priority, split large items, and move properly sized items into sprints.
- Avoid turning backlog items into task-level work prematurely; keep a focus on outcomes and value.
- Balance refinement time (roughly 10% of sprint) with development time (roughly 90%).
- Regularly decompose large items and prune items that no longer fit, using techniques like “dream fragments” to discard low-value items.
- Use Marshall Planning, vision canvases, and other discovery tools to surface context during refinement.
- For large organizations, maintain clarity across multiple teams with two-stage traceability (parent items and child items) to avoid lost alignment.

# Estimation and Forecasting Realities
## Estimates are rough guides, not guarantees
- Estimation is a forecast, not a precise promise; use relative sizing (planning poker, bucket sizing, T-shirt sizes).
- Don’t over-invest time on estimates; deliver workable increments first, then estimate as learning progresses.
- The more complex the product or the newer the team, the lower initial estimation accuracy; improve as you gain experience.
- No-estimation approaches exist (moving toward delivering working increments first), with estimation used as a rough planning guide later.
- Expect a “sweet spot”: too little time yields poor estimates; too much time reduces overall value and accuracy.
- Value and cost information should inform prioritization; estimates alone are not enough to decide.
- Different teams may use different granularity (points, hours, throughput) but should align on what the numbers mean for decision-making.

# Writing User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
## User stories are conversation starters, not definitive specs
- Write end-to-end user stories that reflect outcomes, not just components of the product.
- Acceptance criteria should drive conversation and clarify “done” from the user’s perspective.
- Use interviews, customer journeys, and story mapping to surface needed features and define acceptance tests.
- Treat the backlog item as a conversation piece, not a fixed specification; the discussion continues in the sprint.
- Break stories into small, testable units; avoid large, end-to-end stories that block progress.
- Encourage writing multiple user stories per item, each on its own sticky note, to surface different perspectives.
- Ask: Is the user clearly defined? Are the acceptance criteria testable? Do we have enough context for the development team?

# Discovery Tools, Canvases, and Vision Framing
## A toolbox to surface and align on vision and scope
- Vision boards, Lean Canvas, Marshall Planning, press releases, and vision boxes provide varied lenses to surface assumptions and align on direction.
- Use canvases as collaborative devices to surface stakeholder understanding and surface gaps.
- Pair tools with stakeholder involvement to deepen understanding and buy-in.
- Vision boards are useful, but not the only approach; switch tools based on context and goals.
- Vision mapping often benefits from personas and customer journeys to ground discussions.
- Use a “two-layer” framing: top-level product goals (why) and lower-level features (what), mapped across tools.
- Encourage cross-team participation; ensure the tools catalyze dialogue rather than produce a single artifact.

# Facilitation, Team Dynamics, and Communication
## A good facilitator turns refinement into productive learning
- The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator, guiding workshops, ensuring psychological safety, and enabling equal participation.
- Breakout groups, deliberate silence, and structured dialogue improve learning and alignment; timeboxing helps keep momentum.
- Move around the room (or virtual rooms) to solicit input from different teams and surface hidden concerns.
- Use Q&A, mini-debriefs, and quick feedback loops to surface confusion early.
- Foster an environment where people feel safe to express uncertainty; a lack of psychological safety slows learning.
- Managing remote collaboration requires clear signals, shared timers, and explicit rules for turn-taking and contributions.
- Backlog refinement, vision work, and estimation benefit from a consistent facilitator who can adapt techniques to team needs.
- Include stakeholders and developers in conversations, so ownership and understanding are shared, not imposed.
