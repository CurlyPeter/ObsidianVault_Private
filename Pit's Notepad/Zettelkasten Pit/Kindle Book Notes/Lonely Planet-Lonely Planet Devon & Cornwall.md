OFF THE BEATEN TRACK Bossiney Haven & Trebarwith Strand A secluded and secret(ish) beach within easy reach of Tintagel, the tiny, tucked-away cove of Bossiney Haven is accessible via farmland and steep steps cut into the cliff. The beach is is practically submerged at high tide, and a tough walk up-and-down, so it usually stays pretty quiet. It’s a great place for a picnic and an out-of-the-way dip, but beware – the tide rolls in fast. It’s off the B3263 north of Tintagel; there’s parking in a nearby field, from where it’s a 10 minute walk down to the beach. — location: [8716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H9T6D9C&location=8716) ^ref-27259

Little White Alice COTTAGE ( 01209-861000; www.littlewhitealice.co.uk; Carmenellis; ) This ecoconscious cottage collection is a bit out-of-the-way, up in the hilly country near Stithians Reservoir, but there are few better places for a family-friendly Cornish holiday.
