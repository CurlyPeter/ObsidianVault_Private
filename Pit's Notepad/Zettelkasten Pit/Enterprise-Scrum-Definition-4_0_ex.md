License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT
AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED
UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED
TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing
       works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
       alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
       cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
       adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
       constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For
       the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
       synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
       an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
       anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
       than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
       contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
       unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
       independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
       that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the
       purposes of this License.
    c.   "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through
         sale or other transfer of ownership.
    d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the
       terms of this License.
    e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals,
       entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher;
       and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
       persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic
       works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or

         broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
    f.   "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including
         without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
         mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing;
         a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
         work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
         without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
         analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
         lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
         analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-
         dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a
         broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
         work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
         considered a literary or artistic work.
    g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously
       violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
       permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the
       public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or

         medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from
copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to

    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
       the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,
    b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f),
all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set
forth in Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

                                                                   Agile Management for the 21 Century
    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must
       include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
       Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
       restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
       must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
       every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
       Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
       restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
       recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in
       a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
       to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
       to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
       requested.
    b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is
       primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
       compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-
       sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
       advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
       compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
    c.   If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has
         been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
         reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
         pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
         another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
         ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
         means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
         reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
         unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The
         credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
         however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
         contributing authors of Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
         as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
         may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set
         out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
         assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
         and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
         express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    d. For the avoidance of doubt:
         i.    Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
               to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
               waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
               by You of the rights granted under this License;
           ii.   Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
                 collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
                 the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
                 of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
                 use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and
                 otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
                 licensing scheme; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of

the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).

    e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by
       applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
       part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
       relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO
EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by
       You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You
       under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
       entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
       termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration
       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
       release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
       License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the
       recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
       under this License.
    b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
       the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
       necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    c.   No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
         such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
         or consent.

    d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work
       licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
       Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
       appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
       written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing
       the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
       amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of
       1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
       Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
       relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
       additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included
       in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
       law.

Acknowledgements

First and foremost, I would like to thank Jeff Sutherland for inventing what we now know
as Modern Scrum from his experience and derived knowledge gained from circa 1983
through the fall of 1993. Without his work and inspiration, Enterprise Scrum will not be
possible, mixing Complexity Science, subsumption architecture, org patterns and
Nonaka and Takeuchi’s ideas was a stroke of genius.

Secondly, I want to specially thank all of our other CESTs (Certified Enterprise Scrum
Trainers and Coaches) for their very special support and feedback during or around the
Enterprise Scrum classes: Jon Jorgensen, Juan Saldana, Brett Palmer, Javier Haro,
Michael Herman, Richard Cheng, John McFadyen, Abid Quereshi, Simon Roberts,
Karim Harbott, Catherine Louis, Daniel Mezick, James Schiel, Sue Rye, Jaya
Pattaswamy, Mark Sheffield, Ulises Salvador Aguila Ledezma, Hriday Keni, Marina
Simonova, Savannah Rayat, Lowell Lindstrom, Perez Emilio, John Miller, Stacia
Heimgartner, Rick Waters, Bob Sarni, Alex Menzinsky, Jay Goldstein, Pierre Neis, and
Michael Leber. Without their help and support, we would not be where we are today.

Thirdly, I want to thank all of those of you – customers, practitioners, students,
conference attendees, and fellow Scrum trainers and coaches for:

    1) the interesting conversations and shared insights
    2) the unconditional support over so many years
    3) the feedback on presentations, class materials and coaching
    4) the questions about problems on the field over the years, and
    5) the opportunity to help you in a myriad ways to implement Enterprise Scrum in
       the trenches

I also want to specially thank all the people that helped me review the Enterprise Scrum
documents and ideas and which provided valuable feedback, or supported the
Enterprise Scrum ideas: Peter Stevens, Luis Mulato, Johnny Ordonez, Kris Mir, German
Pellejero, Deniz Ozdemir, Ram Srinivasan, Steve Spearman, Doug Shimp, Peter
Green, Gene Gendel, Martine Devos, Martin Alaimo, and Pablo Tortorella.

Lastly, I also want to acknowledge the deep influence that some authors had on me;
without their ideas and opinions, Enterprise Scrum would not be the same: Steve
Denning, Peter Drucker, Alex Osterwalder, Kim Chan, Renee Mauborgne, Owen
Harrison, Daniel Mezick, Salim Ismail, Clayton Christensen, Adrian Slywotzky, Gary
Hamel, Michael Hammer, Frederic Laloux, Jeremy Hope, Robin Fraser, Eric Ries, Steve
Blank, Jurgen Appelo, Geoffrey Moore, Christopher Alexander, Henrik Kniberg, Alistair
Cockburn, James Coplien and Jim McCarthy.

I hope Enterprise Scrum is useful to all present and future users seeking Business
Agility and Agile Management so that they can use Scrum for:

    1) in a Generic way, 2) in a scaled way, and with 3) more synergistic techniques
       business or otherwise.

This work would have never been completed without the support of my wife and my
family. Thank you Barbara, you really deserve most of the credits!

3.1 – 1/20/2017 Added the Business Agility definition. Edited the Business Agility
chapter.

3.0 – 1/7/2017 – Added many conceptual sections and technical parameters to explain
co-evolutionary and subsumption nature of Enterprise Scrum: surfer (important
aspects), Cycles, waves of Cycles, etc. For example, there are now technical
parameters on surfers, canvases, domain mappings into canvases and surfers and
cycles. Added VLI structure, time, and action modifiers to VLIs officially. Added many
cultural notes and parameters on teams. Added many other debts beyond “technical
debt”. Added subsumption parameters to Cycles.

2.1 – Changed the introduction. Moved the patterns to the Enterprise Scrum Overview.
Made grammar and spelling corrections.

1. ENTERPRISE SCRUM

We define Enterprise Scrum as - business definition:
     Enterprise Scrum is a framework that seeks to quickly deliver the most
     business value and balanced benefits to all people involved.

Here is the Enterprise Scrum -- full definition – skip this if you are not a super nerd:
       Enterprise Scrum is a generic, customer-centric, iterative-incremental, all-at-
       once, scalable, results-oriented, subsumption-based management framework
       that seeks to quickly deliver the most business value and balanced benefits
       to all people involved, through autonomous, self-DMOS teams.

Where self-DMOS means self-directed, self-managed, self-organizing and self-selected.
We use the ES acronym to mean Enterprise Scrum throughout this document.

Notice that in these definitions above, that we say that Enterprise Scrum “seeks” to
deliver some benefits, but these benefits are not guaranteed.

That is mouthful, so let’s explain this a little bit.


ENTERPRISE SCRUM DETAILED EXPLANATION
Let’s define each one of the terms above which describe Enterprise Scrum, and why
they are important.

    •   Enterprise Scrum is generic management, meaning, it can work for many
        different purposes, in many domains, and at different levels of structure.
        Although Enterprise Scrum as presented here, is focused on business
        management, it can also be applied to many other things; for example, managing
        a soccer team, doing projects for college students, or improving the classrooms
        for elementary school students. This genericity is based on abstraction,
        generalization, extension, parametrization and being able to plug things in, like
        techniques. For example, Enterprise Scrum can be used for company, customer
        segment, business model, marketing and sales, product development, software
        development, research, or compliance management; or at the executive, middle
        management, program, or project levels; in any industry. Let’s explain how this
        genericity works.
            o Enterprise Scrum is an abstraction of Scrum because it is a deeper
               description of what Scrum really is. This better understanding makes it
               possible to generalize the concepts. This abstraction really includes all of
               the concepts in this list, which are all important.
            o Enterprise Scrum is a generalization of Scrum, because it uses the same
               concepts in Scrum but in a more general way. For example, Scrum is a 2-
               level subsumption architecture – although this is not described very well in
               the Scrum Guide; while Enterprise Scrum uses a configurable n-level
               subsumption architecture. For example, the subsumption levels in
© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved              14                                st
                                                        Agile Management for the 21 Century
                Business Agility are: company, business units, customer segment, product
                and services, etc.
            o Enterprise Scrum is an extension of Scrum, because it adds many things
                that were not in Scrum either explicitly or not at all before. For example, in
                Scrum we co-evolve “development type” activities like requirements,
                architecture, code, tests, plans, infrastructure, but we don’t explain this
                explicitly specially in the Sprint cycle. Enterprise Scrum extends this
                behavior, and can co-evolve anything that is important together for any
                domain – but that’s something that wasn’t there in Scrum before.
            o Enterprise Scrum is a parametrization of Scrum, because it adds
                parameters to explicitly track things that were in Scrum and additional
                things added in Enterprise Scrum. For example, Cycle length, DOR,
                DOD, were in Scrum before, but not parametrized, but in addition there
                are 150+ other things that are important in Enterprise Scrum, for example,
                the information architecture from Enterprise Scrum, like VLITypes,
                DODStandard, DORStandard, etc.
            o Enterprise Scrum is technique-pluggable, because we can insert explicitly
                techniques specific for different domains. For example, in Enterprise
                Scrum we can use techniques like Lean Startup, Design Thinking,
                Business Model Generation for company management; or User Stories,
                Release Planning, or UTDD for software development; or Internal Controls
                for compliance management, etc.
    •   Enterprise Scrum is customer-centric, it aims to deliver the most business value
        to customers and the most balanced benefit to all people involved, once team at
        a time. That is the purpose of creating a Value List – to delight the customers,
        which Peter Drucker says is the fundamental “source of all goodness”. This may
        appear to be a marketing-like statement, but there are in fact, fundamental
        constructs in Enterprise Scrum to do this. This is why it is presented here as a
        feature.
    •   Iterative-Incremental. In Enterprise Scrum, we get things DONE, grow and
        improve everything iteratively and incrementally through Cycles, from business
        models, to software products, marketing campaigns, compliance, or increased
        customer experience. The reason I am capitalizing DONE, is because getting
        things DONE in Enterprise Scrum has a special meaning: passing DOD
        (definition of done). We manage things assuming rapid change rather than
        assuming a static world where long-term plans and predictions can be made
        without changes; and the Cycles help us to make adjustments after evaluating
        things. This also allow us to take “smaller bets” and “fail faster”.
    •   Enterprise Scrum is all-at-once management, or co-evolutionary management,
        because we get all aspects of things DONE in ONE cycle not through multi-cycle
        phases. For example, instead of having a sequenced semi-parallel phase-based
        approach such as strategy, marketing, product development, sales, customer
        service, we prefer to deliver testable business models, that can be iterated and
        improved through feedback from the market and the customers. This leads to
        faster and better learning, growth, adaptation, visibility, risk management, and
        eventually higher confidence and certainty.

                                                         Agile Management for the 21 Century
    •   Scalable. Enterprise Scrum has the necessary constructs to be scaled in
        different structural, collaboration, delivery modes, delivery targets and contract
        types.
    •   Results-Oriented. Enterprise Scrum is empirical-process management,
        because it’s management is based on measurements.
            o Multiple Metrics. We are not just interested in productivity, cost or profit;
                but instead, we are interested in balancing everything that is important:
                customer experience, user experience, employee experience, profits, and
                a purpose in the world. To this may require multiple metrics to be tracked
                simultaneously.
            o Projections. In Enterprise Scrum, plans, forecasts and decisions are also
                based on measurements made on metrics -- in what is proven that can be
                done, not on what we imagine that can be done. For example, if we are
                managing a sales process, future sales projections are based on the
                current sales measurements.
    •   Enterprise Scrum is subsumption-based because at any level where we use
        Enterprise Scrum, we make decisions and adjustments based on the feedback
        and measurements of the “immediate surrounding reality” associated with it. For
        example, in startup management, we make marketing changes or sales changes,
        based on the immediate feedback of our messages and campaigns.
    •   Enterprise Scrum is a true framework, meaning, there are specific parameters
        that we configure to implement the Enterprise Scrum framework. For example,
        we may configure explicitly Business Value, metrics, charts, Value List (type of
        work, frequency, structure, etc.), DOD, DOR, Planning type, Review type,
        Improve type, canvas, surfers (aspects that are important), subsumption levels,
        etc. Unfortunately, the word “framework” has been abused, but Enterprise
        Scrum is a true framework.
    •   Enterprise Scrum promises to deliver the most business value, but business
        value itself, means different things for different people: better conversion cohorts,
        profit, compliance levels, features delivered, etc.; therefore Business Value itself,
        must be configured.
    •   Balanced Management. We seek to balance the benefit for ALL the people
        involved in whatever we are managing, improving or building. For example, in
        growing a startup company, we may want to find a nice balance: 1) delighting the
        customers by delivering more business value, or a better customer experience,
        2) creating a good employee experience, 3) sharing a purpose to make a better
        world and 4) making profit for our stakeholders.
    •   Autonomous self-DMOS Teams. At a high level, this means greater autonomy,
        decentralization and decoupling. One of our goals is that each Let’s explain what
        self-DMOS is: it’s an acronym for self-directed, self-organized, self-managed and
        self-selected as much as possible instead of working through command and
        control, hierarchical, bureaucratic, functional, phased-based, process oriented, or
        product or service-oriented organizations. This allows us not only to expedite
        things, since there aren’t any vertical or horizontal dependencies, but also to

                                                        Agile Management for the 21 Century
        develop a co-creation participatory culture, with more ownership and pride. For
        example, we want to decouple a single business unit, a customer segment or a
        product or service and manage them as independent as possible.

Again, notice that when we are defining these terms above, we say that we aim or seek
to deliver “more business value”, and “balanced benefits to everyone in the Enterprise
Scrum team – these things are not guaranteed, as well as any other benefits.


ENTERPRISE SCRUM BENEFITS
Now, let’s switch modes. If you do are able to implement the features described above;
then it is possible, but not guaranteed, that you will get some of these benefits for a
single Enterprise Scrum team, or the organization as a whole.

ENTERPRISE SCRUM CONCEPTS AND NAMES
If you already know Scrum, this section may make it easier for you to get Enterprise
Scrum faster.

In Enterprise Scrum, we use “more generic concepts and names” than those used in
Scrum because we are generalizing Scrum to either different levels of scale or other
business processes other than product development, where there may not be any
Products, and where the concept of Sprints as 1-4 week time-box duration may be
insufficient to describe longer-term iterations or nesting of Cycles. We hope that the
Enterprise Scrum “concepts and names” will make it easier to understand and easier to
relate to by workers with different purposes.

In essence, Enterprise Scrum is an abstraction, generalization, parametrization and
extension of Scrum; that is, preserving the basic Scrum rules:
    • we still want to do the work that delivers the most value first
    • we still work, build, learn and improve iterative-incrementally
    • you still want to pass DOD for as much work every Cycle
    • team members still need to self-organize and collaborate with other team
       members
    • Etc.


ENTERPRISE SCRUM INSTANCES
Enterprise Scrum is a true framework:
   • it can be explicitly configured via parameters, and

    •   instantiated, and yielding specific instances.

We typically name different instances using the template:

        “Instance of Enterprise Scrum for doing X”;

We can create Enterprise Scrum instances to manage most everything in an agile way.
For example, these are Enterprise Scrum instances to do very many different things:
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Startup Management with Lean Startup, Design
      Thinking, Blue Ocean Strategy and Business Model Generation
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Company Management with Business Unit
      Portfolio management
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Business Agility
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Scaled Software Development with User Stories
      and Release management
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Marketing and Sales
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Compliance Management
   • Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Real State Sales
   • Etc.

In a recent poll in our Facebook Enterprise Scrum group, we found 50+ instances. You
can join our FB and LinkedIn groups here:
       Facebook:
       https://www.facebook.com/groups/EnterpriseScrum/
       LinkedIn:
       https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7488992


Morphing Instances
You can also have advanced instances that morph and evolve, for example:

        Instance of Enterprise Scrum for Business Agility

that starts with overall company management, adds portfolios of business units and
customer segments, then becomes transformation, and ends up in a never-ending
management of improving portfolios. We teach in our Business Agility classes using
this concept.


Spawning Instances
There are many times when the instances morph, but in a way that they spawn other
instances. For example, for a small startup we typically start with the Enterprise Scrum
– Business Model Canvas, but as the company grows, and the business becomes more
repeatable and scalable, we can then spawn other instances for software development,
marketing and sales, etc.

Configuration
As stated above, we can configure Enterprise Scrum for different purposes and create
instances. Enterprise Scrum has an explicit configuration that is detailed in full, at the
Enterprise Scrum Configuration Guide. However, we include at the end of this
document the Enterprise Scrum Configuration Guide – Quick Reference, which lists
all of the available parameters and their relationships. You don’t have to configure
each and every parameter to configure an instance – instead, configure the least
parameters that make sense for that instance.

Here is a list of all the parameter categories:

instance – defines and configures the instance as a whole
template – configures which template if any are we using
ESTeam – configures the Enterprise Scrum Team
leadership – configures the supporting leaders
customer –configures the customer, market, and Business Value
informationArchitecture –configure the information architecture including VLITypes,
surfers, canvas, DODStandard, DORStandard, etc.
knowledge –configure the techniques and patterns used
valueList – state the Initial Value List and the ongoing Value List
process – defines and configures the overall process in terms of events, based on the
domain and techniques used for the Initial Value List and Cycles
       schedule – tracks all the events, including the Initial Value List and all the Cycle
       instances.
       cycleTypes – defines and configures what Cycles are we using
       metrics – defines and configures which metrics are we using
       reports – defines and configures which reports are we having
       calculations – defines and configures which calculations are we doing
scaling – configure the connections to other Enterprise Scrum instances
       structuralPattern – configures which organizational pattern are we using
       collaborationMode – configures which collaboration mode are we using
       deliveryMode –configures the frequency in which we deliver value
       deliveryTarget –configures the delivery target – type of entity we delivery value
       to
       contractType – configure the contract type

Configuration never really ends, because some things change or we need improvement.
We define the “ongoing configuration”, evolution.




                             Figure 2. Enterprise Scrum Configuration Evolution



However, in Enterprise Scrum, you can use a shortcut to configure an instance by using
a Template, as we show in the next section.

ENTERPRISE SCRUM TEMPLATES
In Enterprise Scrum we can use templates for different things:
    - Instance of Enterprise Scrum – the whole configuration but, it is by definition or
       a template, incomplete
    - Enterprise Scrum Canvases – just the canvas. There are currently 14
       canvases, but they will grow in number fast. Since there are many applications
       of Enterprise Scrum, each one will get its own canvas eventually.
    - Initial Value Lists – template for the Initial Value List
    - Cycle – template for the Cycle sequence
    - Etc.

These parameters explicitly configure a new instance of Enterprise Scrum by copying all
the available parameters in the template to the new instance. See the template section
of the configuration.

For example, a template may have some entries with values already for: ESTeam,
Customer, InformationArchitecture (including VLITypes, surfers, canvas, etc.),
ValueList, valueListSequence, Techniques, Cycles, cycleSequence, etc.; but not
for the initialValueListEvents, cycleInstances, or the schedule since those hold unique
calendar data for the instance.


AGILE MINDSET AND AGILE CULTURE
Culture and mindset are the most important aspects of Scrum and Enterprise Scrum.
No process, framework, methodology is any good ... if it is not powered by the will of
people. And you really can't force people to do things they don't want to do -- you will
always lose, even if some of these things are for their own good.

        "When the Spirit of a people is strong, focused, and vibrant, wonderful things can
        happen. When the Spirit is down, it makes very little difference how good your
        reputation, how much money you have in the bank, or how strong the need for
        your goods or services. Not too much happens."
        [Owen-PowerOfSpirit].

Enterprise Scrum, Scrum and Agile, work a lot better if the people doing the work, are
competent, engaged, and collaborative.

People are much more collaborative, engaged, and want to become more competent,
only if:
         1) they believe in the purpose of what they are doing,
         2) they like doing that kind of work, and
         3) they like working with the people that they work with.

This 3 conditions above, will make it much easier to have the right values to be more
Agile; in other words, it will be easier for them to act with an Agile Mindset.

But be careful, an Agile Mindset, can’t be imposed or forced onto individuals, because

                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
you can’t impose or force values – they must come from the heart to be long-lasting.




                                     Figure 3. Enterprise Scrum Values



An Agile Mindset – operating with the right attitude and values, among several people
leads to higher trust.

When many people that work together have an Agile Mindset, we say that they have an
Agile culture; therefore, in an Agile Culture, there is more trust among the members of a
team or organization. Nonaka describes this as BA in Japanese – a “sharing place”,
where people can: share knowledge, collaborate, cooperate, ask for help, and provide
help to others.

I have recently come up with a concept that captures all the above thoughts as a more
“selective space” in the overall Agile space, as Resonant Agility. This concept
represents the Competence-Engagement-Collaborative Model of Enterprise Scrum.

ENTERPRISE SCRUM TEAM
As in Scrum we only have 3 roles: Enterprise Scrum Team, the Team (people that do
the work), a Business Owner, and a Coach, and they are true roles.




                                     Figure 5. Enterprise Scrum Team



As opposed to Scrum, these are roles, meaning they can be distributed among several
people. We will see though the example, that there are many ways to implement these
roles, some which are more fitting to some environments than others. See the ESTeam
configuration section.

We form Enterprise Scrum Teams, to deliver the most value in the shortest amount of
time. And we do this while we balance other important things like: employee
experience, profit and have a purpose in the world. In general, we can use Enterprise
Scrum to improve, build or manage in any context. For example, we can use Enterprise
Scrum for a soccer team, where we can plan how to play one or more games and then
inspect and adapt.

Enterprise Scrum teams can range from all roles distributed among the team members;
all the way to the traditional Scrum roles, where the Business Owner and the Coach
are a unique single person. These one-person role implementations are indeed useful
patterns to be followed in the appropriate contexts, but limiting for all possible
circumstances. For example, in Enterprise Scrum it is possible to have: companies
without CEOs, scaled development teams without Chief Product Owners, or self-direct,
self-managed and self-organized teams where the Business Owner and Coach are
distributed among the team members like they often are in a startup.

An Enterprise Scrum Team is as autonomous, independent, intelligent, self-directed,
self-managed, self-organized, self-correcting and self-selected as much as possible. An
Enterprise Scrum Team is akin to Smart Tribe with intense customer focus

© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved                 25                                    st

[SmartTribes].

Once we liberate the enterprise from the chains of functional hierarchical management
and handoffs, the different Enterprise Scrum Teams can operate much more
autonomously. Granted, if there are dependencies among business units, customer
segments, or products or services; there needs to be agreements among the different
teams to coordinate these dependencies.

        When doing Enterprise Scrum, we want to decouple and decentralize teams as
        much as possible to seek higher autonomy. Scale by de-scaling.

Enterprise Scrum Teams operate at a much higher operational efficiency than
traditional teams. This is based on reducing waste, and avoiding hand-offs, functional
silos or deep delegation hierarchies. We can understand this, because Agile and
Scrum work, is “reengineered” or compressed work. Also, from an implementation
perspective, Scrum and Enterprise Scrum, use many Lean principles and techniques,
which originated at Toyota, of course. For example, the Value List, is a queue of work
akin to kanban, where the inventory pulled into the team are the VLIs (value list items),
which deliver granules of Business Value. The Cycles by which we accomplish work
are Just-In Time work cycles using small batches of work. And the Retrospectives in
every Cycle are Kaizen (or Deming) Circles.

We have some empirical evidence that Scrum and Enterprise Scrum can deliver
anywhere from 100% - 10,000% productivity gains. But again, the main goal of a
Scrum Team is to deliver a balance of important things: it is useless to achieve a
2000% productivity if the customers are not satisfied, or the employees feel unhappy
and leave the company.

An Enterprise Scrum Team may be formed to manage a company, a portfolio, a
customer segment, a functional area like strategy, marketing and sales, compliance,
etc. – although we much prefer to use all-at-once organizational structures.

Enterprise Scrum Teams can work in many different scaled modes using the scaling
configuration options explained later.


Business Owner
The Business Owner, helped by the stakeholders, defines and orders an Initial Value
List – a list of VLIs (value list items), that when DONE according to a DOD (definition
of done), each contributes with some visible and measurable Business Value directly
or indirectly to the customer.

The responsibilities of the Business Owner are:
   - Manage the vision through the Value List
   - Manage the Value List at all times by defining, prioritizing, or changing it. All of
      these actions are termed “refinement of the Value List”.
   - Working and interacting with the customer and/or the stakeholders.

                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
    -   Delivering Business Value to a customer (or a Customer segment).
    -   The Business Owner is the only person that can modify the Value List.
    -   The Business Owner is also responsible for the success and failure of the
        project, and its ROI.
    -   The Business Owner coordinates, interacts and represents the stakeholders
        and makes consensus about what they need or want.
    -   The Business Owner approves the work, or not, after each Cycle.
    -   The Business Owner always chooses what to deliver
    -   The Business Owner always chooses what to work on – even within a Cycle.
    -   The Business Owner can also provide support to the Team and the Coach

There is a tradeoff with the people that make up the Business Owner:
   - Many people in Business Owner: with more people there is more knowledge
      and arguably better more balanced decisions, but there is also more
      coordination, and potentially, more politics
   - Single Person Business Owner: with one person, we get expedited decisions,
      because there is less coordination, but there is less knowledge.
   - Distributed Business Owner: it is possible that the team distributes the
      Business Owner role among all team members, the risk there is that the team
      either may not have the necessary knowledge, or the time to envision a “better
      future” while they do the work. However, this arrangement works well for
      startups.

When the work for the Business Owner is too large, it is also customary and convenient
to build a Business Owner Team, a group of people that can help accomplish all the
work of the Business Owner. For example, the Business Owner Team can have
SMEs (subject matter experts, power users, business analysts, etc.)
Enterprise Scrum Coach
The Coach:
   - helps configure the Enterprise Scrum framework for a specific purpose:
      Marketing and Sales, Software, Software Scaling, Business Agility, etc.
   - coaches the Enterprise Scrum Team to implement the best Enterprise Scrum
      instance possible
   - proposes initial team members, that hopefully select other team members.
   - helps the team improve technically, socially, emotionally, collaboratively, etc.
   - finds gaps and provides viable strategies to continuously improve everything: the
      team, the process, the configuration, etc.
   - constantly empathizes, encourages, motivates, communicates, assesses,
      mentors, teaches, etc.
   - matches people with what they really want to do, and to work with people they
      like
   - schedules all Enterprise Scrum meetings and activities
   - sends invites and agendas to all Enterprise Scrum meetings
   - shows up to each Enterprise Scrum meeting and facilitates each one of the
      meetings in Scrum
   - facilitates and encourages communications among all parties involved:

                                                    Agile Management for the 21 Century
        Business Owner, stakeholders, and team members.
    -   ensures all the deliverables for every meeting are DONE
    -   removes impediments for the Enterprise Scrum Team
    -   solves issues for the Enterprise Scrum Team
    -   etc.

Just like the case of the Business Owner, you can implement the Coach, with one or
more people, and there are tradeoffs as well:
   - Many people in Coach: with more people there is more knowledge and
        arguably better more balanced decisions, but more coordination and the
        possibility of inconsistencies
   - Single Person Coach: with one person we get consistent coaching, and there is
        less coordination, but less knowledge, experience, and problem solving abilities.
        With a single coach, there is also less time to solve issues.
   - Distributed Coach: it is possible that the team distributes the Coach role
        among all team members, the risks there are that, 1) the team can’t see “beyond
        the forest”, and could get stuck specially in social issues, 2) they just don’t have
        the ability to be a “good coach” collectively.


Team
The Team is one or more people that do the work, but the preferred size is 3-9 people,
like in Scrum. The Team:
    - collaborates, cooperates, shares knowledge, and anyone in the team should help
        other members i.e. is in Nash equilibrium.
    - gets the work defined in the VLIs (Value List Items) of the Value List DONE
        according to their DOD, and delivers Business Value
    - chooses and pulls the amount of work into every Cycle
    - always decides the scope to work that the team can get done as changes take
        place
    - Teams accomplish their work in the most self-organizing way possible. But in
        Enterprise Scrum, we realize that not all new teams are ready to self-organize to
        do their work completely, so it is possible, that they get a mentor or architect
        within the team to get started, and evolve into self-organization.
    - Ideally, the team tells the team how to do their work.
    - Uses its cross-functional expertise to get the work DONE.
    - Ideally, selects other team members as team evolves i.e. is self-selecting. That’s
        not always possible, but it is still ideal.


LEADERSHIP
Enterprise Scrum provides a built-in Agile Leadership model, that is localized for each
agilized activity. We try to make organizations as independent, both horizontally and
vertically; but realistically, there are always some leadership relationships and
dependencies.

Agile Leadership can be applied in two different forms independently, or combined.

                                                        Agile Management for the 21 Century
These two ways are by:
   - External. Having leadership participate in the individual canvases with the
      purpose of providing support. For example, participating and providing support
      participating in a customer segment ES – BMC. The Business Owner role here
      is critical, as it can front-end much of the communication with leadership making
      them stakeholders. A well-designed organization will not have too many
      stakeholders – that is already a red flag that the organization is probably not
      designed very well.
   - Integrated. The leadership team having their own canvas with activities that
      provide support for other teams. For example, being part of an Enterprise
      Scrum Team that is managing a company – a portfolio of business units in a
      company, and providing support by communicating and collecting customer
      segment feedback. In other words, the leadership team is/are Business
      Owner(s), of a supporting organization, and it is assumed that the Business
      Owner of the organization

Ideally, the leaders associated with an Enterprise Scrum instance, are also using
Enterprise Scrum for a different purpose (integrated); but we can’t assume that in
general – that’s why the leaders may be external.

Ideally, the leaders in the leadership team would provide support in many ways:
   - resolve leadership issues: e.g. conflicting direction, removing political situations,
       or other impediments the team can’t.
   - resolve issues with others in our behalf:
           o provide funding
           o approve hiring people
           o get other types of approvals or resources
   - provide direct support for the team:
           o make some decisions that only leadership can make
           o communicating important information
           o resolving team issues that only leadership can resolve
           o help the team make some decisions
           o help the team resolve dependencies
           o help us establish partnerships and collaborations
   - adapt their leadership style depending on the needs of the team(s). Different
       teams may need, in fact, different styles of leadership.

In terms, of leadership style, here is the Enterprise Scrum Leadership Model:

                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
                             Figure 6. Enterprise Scrum Agile Leadership Model

In Enterprise Scrum, in terms of the freedom that the team has in “doing their work”, we
assume that the Team can at least be empowered to self-organize, and prefer the
leadership collaborating and participating. So we clearly prefer to be in the green
area; but we realize that sometimes other options are needed like temporary controlling,
coordination, directing, advising, guiding or delegating actions.

The leadership group is a different group than the stakeholder group in Enterprise
Scrum, because by definition, a stakeholder is a person having influence i.e. “say so” in
Value List, but a leader, the way it is defined in Enterprise Scrum, is about providing
supporting. There could be an overlap between the stakeholders and the leaders, of
course; but we don’t make any general assumptions of overlap between the leaders and
stakeholders, that’s why there are 2 separate lists.


CUSTOMER
Enterprise Scrum seeks to deliver the most Business Value in the shortest amount of
time to a customer or customer segment. Therefore, it is a good idea to know what
industry, what area of the industry, what segment we are serving, and what Business
Value is for our customers. That way we can better organize our Value List and help
them seek a better purpose. See the Customer configuration section.


Business Value
Business Value in Enterprise Scrum is measured through a business relevant metrics
in that process, domain or industry such as one or more of the following: customer
satisfaction, revenue, profit, ROI, market share, a measure of competitive advantage;
but we prefer that this is realized business value not potential business value.
Business Value can be anything of value in that domain or for that industry. For
example, for compliance management, it could a higher level of compliance or less
incidents; but for a software development effort, it is typically features done.

                                                                Agile Management for the 21 Century
We must measure Business Value appropriately to have empirical evidence that we in
fact, have obtained some Business Value. This will also give us a metric to improve
the delivery of Business Value in the future through Cycles. It is also typical to create
charts for the metrics for our measurements or calculations.


KNOWLEDGE
In Enterprise Scrum we can configure the specific patterns and techniques used and
for what purpose. Also, we have the option to gather knowledge over time, as we learn
and convert “chaos into order”: chaos into complex, then complicated and then simple
[Cynefin].

See the knowledge section of the configuration.


Patterns
Patterns for different domains are available as “best practices”. Enterprise Scrum can
also help us to list and remember patterns in our instances, either learned or
discovered.

For example, If we are building a startup, we may want to use Business Model
Generation patterns [BusinessModelGeneration]. If we are doing product strategy, we
may want to use some of the Profit Patterns available [ProfitPatterns]. If we are building
an Enterprise Architecture, we may want to use enterprise architecture patterns. If we
are building a software architecture, we may want to use the best possible design and
architectural patterns [DesignPatterns], [POSA1], [POSA2].


Techniques
Likewise, we can introduce a number of techniques to get the work done for different
domains. For example, for Company Management:
   • Blue Ocean Strategy - Strategic Canvas, ERRC [BlueOcean]
   • Design Thinking [DesignThinking]
   • Lean Startup- pivoting [LeanStartup]
   • Business Model Generation - BMC, VPD [BusinessModelGeneration]
   • Profit Zone – Profit Patterns [ProftZone], [ProfitPatterns].
   • Exponential Organizations - MTP [ExponentialOrganizations]
   • Scenario Planning – Scenarios [ScenarioPlanning],
   • Red Ocean Strategy – competitive analysis, 5-force analysis [Porter1], [Porter2],
   • Beyond Budgeting – rolling budgets [BeyondBudgeting].
   • Etc.

Techniques can be high-level, and define extra steps in the Initial Value List, for
example, Strategy Canvas from Blue Ocean Strategy; or they could be extremely low-
level techniques through execution, for example the usage of Design Patterns in
software development.

                                                      Agile Management for the 21 Century
Techniques may also result into many specific steps in the process of an instance,
which can be accounted, configured and remembered in Enterprise Scrum. For
example, using User Stories in software development triggers: User Story Workshops,
Planning Poker, User Story Refinement, etc. This is important information that we can
capture, if we wish to re-instantiate the instance for some other team.


INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (ADVANDED SECTION)
The information architecture of the domain breaks down what we do:
What do we deliver and to who?
What are the list of deliverables?
This translates into VLITypes.

What is the principal way we deliver value?
What are the aspects of what we deliver and who is responsible for them? These are
the Surfers.

What are the attributes of the surfers?
These translate into the additional attributes of a VLIType.

The information above derives:
   - the canvas for the activity,
   - the initial value list for the activity, and
   - the cycle structure


Canvas
In Enterprise Scrum, we coevolve the Surfers on the Canvas (all important aspects or
attributes of ALL important things == VLITypes), through waves of Cycles in
subsumption mode. In Enterprise Scrum, we create different canvases for different
activities, to make it easier to see all the aspects at once -- our coevolved Surfers.

For example, if we are using Enterprise Scrum to manage a startup, we may want to
use the Enterprise Scrum – Business Model Canvas:




© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved            32                                 st
                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
                            Figure 7. Enterprise Scrum Business Model Canvas

All of the boxes above, are all the VLITypes, by definition, and each one of them has
one or more attributes – we call these the surfers.

Similarly, we can build canvases for any activity: company management, executive
management, startups, portfolio management, business units, customer segments,
products, services, marketing, compliance, software development, etc. See the
included canvases.

This is in fact such a good practice, that we have added this as a general technique:
Build Your Canvas Pattern.

It is actually really easy. We just ask the right questions:
What do we deliver after each Cycle? Those are the VLITypes.
What attributes do these things have? Those are the “surfers” or attributes of the VLIs.

For everything you manage in Enterprise Scrum you can build a custom Canvas that
includes “everything that is important” and co-evolve it together through Cycles.

For example, in software development it is important to track customer satisfaction,
requirements, architecture, the plan, the development team, etc. The Canvas, by
definition, must include all important things – all the “surfers”, attributes of the VLITypes.

The list of surfers, then map to the scheduled events to build the Initial Value List, and
the PC3R Cycles, if in addition to the above questions we ask: Who delivers these
aspects? Through which activities?

That’s how we get from “important things” to an Initial Value List process definition in
Enterprise Scrum.

Within an instance, we can use the Canvas to:
   - Fill in the “initial big picture” through the Initial Value List
   - Then, we can coevolve everything, including the dependencies among VLITypes,
       through the different Surfers through the PC3R Cycles, until we reach our
       objectives.

Canvases are useful as a template to get started faster using Enterprise Scrum.


VALUE LIST
The Value List represents the vision at any one time, and targets a purpose, through a
list of VLIs, each of which bring Business Value to a customer, internal or external.
There is one Value List per Scrum Team which is composed of VLIs. This is how an
Enterprise Scrum team manages all of its work.

Enterprise Scrum, like Scrum, is a system for getting things done all-at-once in each
Cycle. For different types of work, we will have different VLITypes, that coevolve
different important aspects. See the VLITypes, ValueList and ValueListItem
configuration options.

For example, in financial trading, a trade may have 1) business requirements, 2) an
implementation strategy, 3) compliance requirements, 4) reporting requirements, etc.

We may have other VLIs that add direct, or indirect Business Value, but we typically
have what we call a primary VLI – a primary activity that brings business value, and
potentially several other activities. For example, in a real-state process, the properties
to be sold, are the primary VLI.


VLIs
Each VLI delivers granular, direct or indirect, Business Value for a specific domain.
For example, a VLI for real-state sales would be a property sold, and we coevolve 1) the
price, 2) the sale terms, 3) the property, 4) the marketing of the property, etc. In
software development a VLI is a feature or “user story”, and we coevolve 1) the
requirements, 2) the team, 3) the plan: budget, schedule, risk; 4) the architecture, 5) the
DOD, 6) the deliverable product increment, etc.

VLIs can have many different attributes depending on their type. The VLI attributes are
a very important and key aspect of Enterprise Scrum, because they generalize work.
We call the aspects or attributes of a VLIType, the Surfers.

For example, a VLI will eventually have information about:
   - the plan to get it DONE,
   - its DOR (Definition of Ready), different than the DORStandard

© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved          34                                   st
                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
    -   its DOD (definition of done), different than the DODStandard
    -   volunteers that completed the work,
    -   dependency with other VLIs,
    -   domain-specific “surfer type” attributes,
    -   administrative information: who created it, when was it added, approved, what it’s
        budget, revenue, profit, or other related metrics.
    -   time constraints, VLIs can be cycle, un-selectable, scheduled, repeatable;
    -   structure information: singleton, collection, workflow or conditional;
    -   regarding action type, they can be work, refine, decide, test, answer, monitor.
    -   Etc.

As stated above, once we map the extra VLI attributes for a VLIType, indirectly we will
need to map the Initial Value List activities, and what gets DONE in the PC3R Cycles.
Two very important attributes that deserve additional clarification are the DOR and
DOD.
VLI-DOR
In Enterprise Scrum, there must be an explicit DOR (definition of ready). The DOR tells
you when a VLI is ready to be worked on.

VLI-DOD
In Enterprise Scrum, as we do in Scrum, DONE is not a fuzzy-defined thing. We must
specify “when are we done”, for any business process where we want to use Enterprise
Scrum as specifically as we can.

We prefer that DONE is not “partially done”, “almost done”, “I think it’s done”, and that
instead, it is a well-defined concept. For example, in a real-state process, a sale, has a
definite DOD (definition of done):

    1) we must have a completed inspection
    2) we must have a signed sales contract
    3) we must have a cashier’s check that includes the total price, fees and closing
       costs
    4) etc.

And the same is true in other business processes. Our goal is to get things DONE
according to DOD each and every Cycle.


ENTERPRISE SCRUM PROCESS
The Enterprise Scrum process is very simple: it is an iterative incremental process
through Cycles that starts with a Vision and an Initial Value List to accomplish that
vision, but the activities of Initial Value List and the Cycles can be configured based on
the canvas for that domain.

        Vision
        Initial Value List

                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
        Cycle
        Cycle
        Cycle
        Cycle
        Cycle
        (… until we achieve our goals.)

In Enterprise Scrum we do iterative incremental empirical-process management by
measuring one or more things after each Cycle, and then improving the work, the team
and the vision through feedback as needed to achieve our goals. See the
InitialValueList and Cycle configuration sections.

Cycles can be as short as one hour, and as long as a year. They can also be nested in
time and structure. For example, we could have bi-weekly Cycles contained by
quarterly Cycles (a very common pattern). Or have Business Unit cycles wrapping
Customer Segment Cycles.

Cycles are also associated with the Surfers as define above -- important things that are
coevolved in subsumption for that level, as we talked about when we introduced the
Value List. Each cycle, we do PCRI: Plan, Collaborate to get DONE, Review or
Improve anything in the canvas.

Sometimes is convenient to have a vision for what will happen after many cycles. We
call this a Release Plan or Roadmap, and sometimes it is useful to document it.

The Scrum Team can perform measurements on the metrics on what got DONE
according to a DOD such as: customer satisfaction, employee experience, profits, sales,
compliance levels, etc.; and make Plans based on these measurements to improve,
adapt, and manage.

We will use this process as a template to describe different processes such as Startup
management, portfolio management of all sorts, compliance management, marketing
and sales management, etc.
Vision
The Business Owner helped by the stakeholders define a vision. Typically to delight
the customers. But again, keep in mind we must balance employee happiness, profits,
and having a purpose in the world or whatever else is important in that domain.

Think of the Vision as a “fuzzy deformed ghost” that becomes real as you get more
thing done: you can’t see the end exactly it doesn’t matter how smart you are. So, it is
just that, a vision.


Initial Value List
The Business Owner helped by the stakeholders map the Vision to an Initial Value
List by defining the individual VLIs to accomplish the Vision. This typically is achieved

                                                      Agile Management for the 21 Century
through a series of activities to accomplish the DOR (definition of ready - see below),
and through an Initial Value List process as described above.

For example, in Startup Management, a VLI is ready if it has been defined, prioritized,
and sized in effort and cost – this is different than standard Scrum. In general, these
activities may change depending on the DOR and depend on the activity, and therefore
the Canvas for the activity. Generalizing, software development, sales, compliance,
HR, finance or portfolio management, have different Canvases and therefore different
Initial Value List processes and DORs.


Cycles and Cycle Structure – PCRI
In Enterprise Scrum, we generalize the 2-level subsumption architecture behavior of
Scrum, into an n-level and m-things in subsumption for any domain. Subsumption
simply means “checking with the surrounding reality of that domain” and adapting as
needed by changing behavior.

Therefore, in Enterprise Scrum, we must decide, which things are coevolved in which
Cycles, and at what level, and then coevolve them through appropriate Cycles. For
example, for a real-state sales process, we may choose to coevolve the sales activities
and the self-organization of the team at the day level, and the 1) overall sales, 2) sales
projections, 3) sales infrastructure and 4) overall team improvements at the 1st Cycle
level, usually with a duration of 1-4 weeks.




                                Figure 8. Cycle Structure in Enterprise Scrum



The Cycle structure in Enterprise Scrum is:

        Planning – where the Team determines in part 1. how much work they think
        they can do for all Surfers. The workers PULL IN the work. In part 2, how they
        will do the work. For example, the team members can volunteer for the VLIs
        accepted and plan for each of them according to a DOD (definition of done). The
        Enterprise Scrum team plans for everything in the Canvas. For example, a sales
        team may want to plan for: 1) marketing message, 2) campaigns, 3) feedback
        techniques, 4) closing techniques, 5) overall sales, 6) sales projections, 7) sales

© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved                  37                                     st
                                                                 Agile Management for the 21 Century
        infrastructure, and 8) team improvements, etc. In Enterprise Scrum part 2, and
        even the whole planning can be configured as optional depending on the context.

        Collaboration – the goal is to accomplish as much work that passes a DOD
        through collaboration, cooperation, helping each other and sharing knowledge for
        that Cycle. Ideally, the Business Owner is clarifying things as needed and pre-
        approving as many VLIs instead of waiting for Review to do so. The Daily
        Scrums are also optional, depending on context. If the team is interacting and
        know their decencies all the time, they are not mandated.

        Review – This is the last opportunity for the Business Owner to review and
        accept the work DONE in a Cycle to incrementally deliver some Business Value.
        It is much preferred that we actively interact with the Business Owner during the
        Cycle to approve things before we get to the Review. For example, a sales team
        may want to review: 1) marketing message, 2) campaigns, 3) feedback
        techniques, 4) closing techniques, 5) overall sales, 6) sales projections, 7) sales
        infrastructure, and 8) team improvements, etc. At Review we can also review
        anything of interest in the canvas, but we always review the primary VLI first -
        the VLIType that provides most Business Value. For example, in software
        development, we first review the features or requirements of the product
        increment.

        Improve – At Improve, we have the opportunity to improve anything of interest
        on the Canvas including the team. The main idea is to choose a better direction
        to go to including everything we do. For example, a sales team may want to
        improve: 1) marketing message, 2) campaigns, 3) feedback techniques, 4)
        closing techniques, 5) overall sales, 6) sales projections, 7) sales infrastructure,
        and 8) team improvements, etc.


We call 1) marketing message, 2) campaigns the Surfers of Marketing and Sales for
the 1st level Cycle, and the ES – BMC above.; and we call the 1) day-to-day sales
activities and 2) the self-organization of the team the surfers of the day cycle.


METRICS
Metrics track important things that were DONE in a Cycle that are important to
PEOPLE: the customer, the employees, stakeholders, and even people in the world.
As such, Cycles can be used to improve one or more metrics, which may be of
different metric types, for example:
    • customer satisfaction
    • customer experience
    • employee experience
    • profit
    • cost savings
    • productivity

    •   quality
    •   performance
    •   learning
    •   accomplishment
    •   building
    •   adaptation
    •   transformation
    •   improvement or
    •   growth
    •   etc.

or whatever is important for whatever we are trying to do.

To visually see the progress or evolution of the metrics within a Cycle we can use one
or more charts. For example, we can use a Burndown chart or a different graph to
track one or more things simultaneously.


CALCULATIONS
In Enterprise Scrum, we can have calculations related to the Cycles using the data
measured before. For example, we can make projections of sales, customer
satisfaction, compliance, effort or budget based on previous measurements in the
previous Cycles.

This doesn’t mean that we make “static future plans” in Enterprise Scrum. It only
means that we can make the “best prediction” given what we know at some point in
time. For example, we may calculate schedules, budgets, scope to be achieved by a
certain date, customer satisfaction, total net sales, etc.

Here is an example for Schedules and Releases

The value list size is:
VL-Size = size (from the valueListItem in the appropriate sizingUnit)

Number of Cycles:
ICs (Cycles) = VL-Size (Value List size)/ V (velocity in the appropriate metric)

Then we simply calculate time as:

Schedule = ICs * length

Where length is the length parameter in the Cycle.

Burn rates

The total cost is:

© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved          39                                   st
                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
TC (Total Cost) = resources * average salaries * HR factor + proposal cost + other fixed
costs

And therefore the burn rate is:
BR (Burn Rate) = TC/Number of Yearly Cycles

Budgets

Since we know the burn rate and the number of Cycles, we can then calculate the
budget:

$ (Budget with no profit) = ICs * BR

Even with a profit percentage X:
$ (Budget with X% profit) = ((1 + X)/100) * $

We can do similar calculations for sales projects, net profit, cumulative customer
satisfaction, etc.

We can in fact include a “repeatable VLI” with the purpose of producing this calculation,
as an explicit way to include this calculation in a given Cycle. This makes it natural to
include Release Planning calculations, or any other projection.


EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER MULTIPLE CYCLES
Rome wasn’t created in one Cycle; and neither is an Agile business. Growing an Agile
business is an evolutionary process. And it takes evolution in time to transform
organizations, to grow products or services, and to find better business directions. In
fact, a recurrent and common pattern in just about every subject that has hard activities
or goals is that of “Iterative Incremental growth”.

Iterative Incremental growth or adaptation, is found as a fundamental principle in
Cosmology, Architecture, Biology, Physics and Mathematics, Political Science,
Medicine, etc., and it also relates to the metrics above. Iterative Incremental growth is
at the center of revolutionary thoughts like the Alexanderian architecture concepts
explained in the Timeless Way of Building [Alexander].

Henrik Kniberg makes the point that the Iterative and Incremental is also a risk
management technique: we don’t have to know everything up front, and we don’t have
to deliver the value all at once.

           Figure 9. Comparison of business value delivery from Waterfall to Iterative Incremental



Enterprise Scrum brings professional iterative and improvement management to the
whole or any part of organization; and if you do it right, it brings with it all of its cultural
tradeoffs of sharing knowledge, cooperation, collaboration and helping each other.


Improvement and Growth
There are many instances of Enterprise Scrum where the expected behavior is
improvement and growth through exponential growth with saturation. This is because
“growth” can only go so far, for example, velocity in a software development team, or
profits (from sales) in a saturated real-estate market.

We can grow our business models, products, services, our teams or transformations. In
Enterprise Scrum and Scrum everything is done iteratively and incrementally; so we
grow everything: sales, revenue, profit, quality, customer satisfaction, organizations,
transformations, quality, etc.

Growth typically follows an S-curve, or a sequence of S-curves, really.

                       Figure 10. S curve expected growth or improvement over time.



One of Jeff Sutherland’s first Scrum articles advertised a measured 600% improvement.
But of course, this improvement was not achieved in one Sprint – it was the iterative
incremental growth process. By the way, I prefer not to call either Sprints or Cycles
“iterations”. Iteration gives you the wrong impression that you are iterating “doing the
same again and again”; but in Scrum as in Enterprise Scrum we don’t want to do the
same – we want to improve and do it better after every Sprint or Cycle.

In Enterprise Scrum, we don’t limit ourselves to improve the “amount of work DONE” or
velocity, and neither do the best Scrum teams. Instead, we rather seek to improve
customer satisfaction, employee experience, quality, return on investment, sales,
compliance levels – just about anything we want through the introduction of metrics. In
fact, we prefer to improve, optimize or maximize not only one quantity but several of
them together to seek a more “balanced management”.

We should expect a saturation curve or S curve for our growth and improvements: 1) at
first it’s hard to improve, 2) then we quickly improve but 3) slow down as we reach the
saturation point, where it may become more difficult to improve.

The Enterprise Scrum S-curve is modelled by a variant of the “logistic equation” or
sigmoid curve:
                                     𝐹 𝑥 = 𝐿/(1 + 𝐵 ∗ e(−k ∗ 𝑥 − 𝑥𝑜 ))

where:
    •   e = natural logarithm base
    •   xo = the midpoint value
    •   L = the curve’s maximum value
    •   L/(1 + B) is the initial f(0) initial metric
    •   k = steepness of the curve


Adaptation and Moving Targets
One universal aspect of open information systems, is that implicitly, they may cause our
goals to shift or change over time. For example, a changing regulatory environment,
could dramatically change the features of a hardware product, like an oil rig, a turbine,
or telephone switch. Yet, we must adjust our work to “chase the moving target”.

Fortunately for us, Scrum and Enterprise Scrum are designed for that purpose: to
easily adapt or change as NEW information changes or comes into the process. This
makes Scrum and Enterprise Scrum a better fit for processes with changing information.

After an iteration at any one level we could make adaptations at different levels to
optimize what we defined as business value.

    •   Change our business model, or
    •   Change our product, service or process – changing the concept of them, or
    •   Change or add features to an evolving product, service or process, or
    •   Improve our team, process, or customer service.

How can do we accomplish this? By making things transparent after each Cycle
(weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.), so that we can inspect and adapt after each Cycle
choosing better behaviors for our company, program, project or team. This works is a
nested multi-level subsumption architecture – choosing behaviors by analyzing context,
at every level of scale; which has always been an important element in Scrum.

Recursive Cycles
A common thing to do among very many Enterprise Scrum instances, is to add an
envelope Cycle:

Vision è Big Cycle (Long-term wave prediction)
             Small Cycle (corrective prediction)
             Small Cycle (corrective prediction)
             Small Cycle (corrective prediction)
             Small Cycle (corrective prediction)
       è Big Cycle (end)

In Software Development or Startup Management, this is called Release Planning. For
example, for Startup management we are interested in finding a viable:
    • Business Model
    • Product or Service
    • Effective Marketing
    • Revenue/Profit

simultaneously, so we would first try an initial business model with a product or service,
with an initial marketing in our “big Cycle”, use some metrics on customer satisfaction,
profit and revenue and then adapt our initial predictions on Business model, Product
and Service, Marketing in each of the small Cycles.

Another example, in software development we try to predict:
   • Requirements
   • Architecture and
   • Plan
So, we can do a first pass making these long-term prediction “on the rough”, and then at
the end of every small Cycle, make a correction to the original “long-term predictions.
This is what leads to the release plan is then updated after every Cycle. You can nest
as many Cycles as needed as long as you update the envelope plans after each of the
smaller Cycles.


Wave Principle
In general, this behavior can be captured, through the Wave Principle is:

        Wave Principle. Any long-term “rough” predictions made in the Initial Value List
        of a longer Cycle, must be refined or recalculated after each and every shorter
        Cycles it includes.

The Wave Principle allows iterative-incremental coevolution and projections of multiple
aspects or entities.

The wave is a useful metaphor, because each of the enclosing cycles in the wave
triggers a “rolling wave” of “predictions”. This is exactly how Beyond Budgeting works.

                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
But this behavior is now generalized in Enterprise Scrum for any activity:

        Software Development: requirements, architecture, plan
        Company Management: profits, revenue
        HR:                   projections on number of hires
        Compliance:           projections on compliance or incident levels
        Etc.

By the way, it is a common misconception that “long-term” plans can’t be done, or
should not be done with Enterprise Scrum (or Scrum) but this is simply not true: As
long as the longer plans are updated after each small Cycle, there is no problem in
making longer term plans.

From the implementation point of view, the long-term Cycle plan is implemented by a
Value List – by a specific list of VLIs to do to achieve the long-term vision.


REPORTS
ES - ScrumBoard
To track how much work we have done, we use a ES - Scrum Board across many
Cycles. The ES - ScrumBoard shows us how much work we have selected to work on
a Cycle (selected), how much work is work in progress (WIP), and how much work we
got to DONE.

We describe how Enterprise Scrum PCRI cycles work above, but let’s work through how
these Cycles fit into the ES - ScrumBoard.

At the Cycle Planning we 1) move the chosen work from the “not selected” canvas or
column into the selected/WIP column, and optionally, 2) we make an initial plan on how
we are going to getting to DONE. For example, if we are doing compliance
management, it could be an internal control that needs to be chosen and a plan on how
is going to be tested. In Enterprise Scrum, however, we can choose 3 options to do
planning: 1) traditional Scrum with part 1 and part 2, 2) just part 1, with the team self-
organizing to make the plan on the go, 3) no planning at all, just self-organizing to
choose the work and do the work working with the Business Owner.

At Collaboration we work on it and get it to DONE. For example, it could be an internal
control that needs to be tested by generating a trading report.

At Review, we move everything that got DONE to the DONE Canvas or column, and
then we meet with the Business Owner, and show or review what we got DONE in the
entire Canvas at execution and explain anything that is important. Review sessions,
can have many sub-parts – as many as boxes in the Canvas. But at the very least, they
should have the traditional Scrum reviews on 1) what we got done, 2) how the team is
working.

                                                       Agile Management for the 21 Century
At Improve we improve anything we can that makes sense in the Canvas including 1)
the things that deliver Business Value directly, 2) how to improve the team, 3) how to
improve results and metrics, etc.




                    Figure 12. ES - ScrumBoard tracks how much work is getting DONE.

Typically, we define metrics on what we got DONE. For example, in compliance
management we could keep track on
Charts
In contrast with regular Scrum, in Enterprise Scrum we are at liberty to use any chart
that is useful to us, not just a “burndown chart”. This can be configured in the ES
configuration.

For example, we could use a chart to track the metric “daily number of incidents” or
even “cumulative number of incidents” within a Cycle in compliance. Or we could track
“daily real state sales”, or “cumulative real state profits”, if we are tracking real-state
sales process.


SCALING
Enterprise Scrum provides very many scaling options as well. These scaling options
work not only for software development, but for any scaled Agile activity, such as
marketing and sales, compliance, company management, transformation, etc.

These scaling options are organized in 1) structural patterns, 2) collaboration modes, 3)
delivery modes, 4) delivery targets, 5) contract types. Each one of these options has 4
sub options, giving a total of 4^5 = 1024 total number of combinations.

Why so many options? Because scaling is a very complex subject. Other frameworks
trivialize the domain, and give the impression that canned, simple solutions can work;
but this is a mistake that may lead to inappropriate solutions that may cause trouble,
pain and harm.

Some of the options apply to single teams as well.

Apply to Single Team:
Delivery Mode: CDep, CDel, Cycle, Release
Contract Type: Fixed Price, Fixed Date (+DevOps), T&M, cost+

Apply to Single Team and multiple teams working together:
Structural Patterns: Centralized BO+C, Centralized BO, Collaboration V(T+BO),
Chameleon
Collaboration Mode: centralization, delegation, collaboration, subsumption
Delivery Target: project/product/ process, program, portfolio, Enterprise

Let’s explain each one of these options in detail.


Structural Patterns
Centralized Business Owner and Coach – works for 3-4 teams where there is a
business expert. For example, implementing a trading system.

Centralized Business Owner – works well up to 7 teams, depending on context. Each
team now has it’s own Coach.

Potluck Scaling - Collaboration Virtual Business Owner – works well for portfolios
where there is not a lot of number of contributors, and they can make agreements

Chameleon – same as above, but now with a coordinator that can work in different
collaborations modes (see below).

                               Figure 13. Enterprise Srum Structural Patterns

Collaboration Modes
Centralization
There is a central Business Owner specifying and checking requirements.

Delegation
The teams are coordinated by a Chief Business Owner, and a Chief Coach in a
hierarchical delegation mode. At the Initial Value List and at each PCRI Cycle, there
are V-like meetings for Planning, Review, and Improve and then the work is “delegated
to the lower teams”.

Collaboration
The work is done by the teams’ Business Owner making collaborative agreements with
other teams. There is no one is a Chief anything.

Subsumption
Works like collaboration, but in addition, the Business Owners are part of a different
subsumption level Enterprise Scrum Team. For example, all product and services
teams for a Customer Segment, or a Business Unit, are part of the portfolio-level
Scrum.


Delivery Modes
Continuous Deployment. Value Increment is continuously deployed as soon as
possible by passing DOD and deploying immediately.

Continuous Delivery. Value Increment is continuously delivered by integrating and
testing comprehensively and passing DOD as soon as needed, but not deployed to
production.

Cycle Deployment. Value Increment is deployed by passing DOD each Cycle.

Release (Coincident multi-Cycle) Value Increment is deployed in releases but value
can be delivered through continuous delivery or Cycle delivery.


Delivery Targets
Large Project – 2 or more teams working to deliver a large project
Program – 2 or more projects working through multi-disciplinary teams
Portfolio – 2 more teams contributing (dependent or independent)
Enterprise Architecture – ALL business areas included

This can work for any business process: SW, HR, HW, marketing and sales,
compliance, etc.; or even the whole company, Business Agility.

Contract Types
T&M – time and materials, typically allows changes in both scope and release date

Fixed Date – typically means time and materials and variable scope. We want to
deliver all the “must have” functionality and as much of the “want to haves” and “nice to
haves”. When the fixed dates are recurring, we get an “operations”, “subscription like”
recurring expense. Some people call this DevOps.

Fixed Price – typically means fixed scope and fixed date, but sometimes it can be
variable date.

Cost+ - fixed cost for the initially agreed upon functionality, PLUS whatever changes
additionally.


IMPEDIMENTS, ISSUES AND DEBTS
Enterprise Scrum provides a way to track, manage and resolve impediments, issues
and debts. First, let’s define these terms:
   - Issues are problems with a range of severity.
   - Debts are things that we should be doing but we are not.
   - Impediments are issues that are blocking us to do work or get results.

Issues, impediments and debts can occur at many different levels of scale, from an
individual, to the whole company.

Here are some examples of issues – some of them may be or become impediments:
   • Not being able to connect temporarily to an LDAP server
   • A problem with implementing a specific internal control
   • Not getting enough feedback from the Business Owner in a Cycle
   • Not having an answer for a specific decision: can we get the new servers by end
      of year?
   • Etc.

Here are some examples of debts:
   • technical debt
   • refinement debt
   • decision debt
   • research debt
   • monitoring debt
   • change debt
   • cultural maturity debt
   • motivation debt
   • learning debt

Issues and debts can be filled out at any time, but most of them typically come up at the
Improve sessions.

We also provide a graphical representation that we call the Debt-Issue Canvas to
make it easier for teams to see issues, impediments or debts. Impediments are issues
that are marked typically with a red dot to highlight them.

2. ENTERPRISE SCRUM EXAMPLE – STARTUP OR INNOVATIVE BUSINESS
UNIT

NAME

The instance of Enterprise Scrum for Startup Management
The instance of Enterprise Scrum for Innovative Business Unit

We can do this in both a Red Ocean (competitive market), or in a NEW Blue Ocean
market (uncontested market space).



ADVANTAGES
Motivation
A startup (or new business unit) as defined by Steve Blank is [Blank] is:

        A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable,
        profitable business model.

We can best manage all phases of a startup (or new business unit) in an Agile way with
Enterprise Scrum to achieve this scalable, repeatable and profitable business model:
   1) from the time is searching for its business model
   2) through initial growth
   3) scalability and profitability, or
   4) even as it is phased out if things are not working out.




                                     Figure 15. Startup Timeline

Enterprise Scrum is a good way to manage a startup because it allows the evolution of
everything that is important “all at once”: the customer, the business model, the solution

(product or service), marketing and sales, and the startup team and its processes
simultaneously.


Industry Impact
Enterprise Scrum allows startups or new innovative business units, to be managed in an
accelerated and more effective way. In that sense, Enterprise Scrum serves as an
accelerator program for the startup (innovative business units).

Why is this important? Because of disruption.

As we enter the Innovation Revolution (4th Industrial Revolution), the number of
successful startups (or new company innovative divisions), will accelerate not only in
numbers but in revenue and profit. Some of them will become MTPs (massive
transformative purposes), like Uber, Tesla, Slack, Oculus Rift, etc. Disruption is the
mark of MTPs.

Wealth has never been created, transformed or destroyed this fast ever.

Here is a chart that shows that “Time to Unicorn” is rapidly decreasing in time:




                                     Figure 16. Time to Unicorn vs time

Being more pleasing or transformative to the customer and delivering faster and better
solutions to the market has never yielded more profits and revenue than today.
Remember, roughly 50% of the companies that were here in the year 2000 are not here
any more. So this instance, and other instances like this, have the potential to
determine who are the winners, or the losers in the 21st century.

        TWEET: Wake up before DISRUPTION UBERizes your company. Innovate,
        delight customers, make employees happy, find an MTP #ES

                                Figure 17. NYC Taxi Medallion Prices vs Time

As startups, unicorns and traditional companies in any industries compete for the
current GWP (Growth World Product) of 75 trillion (Geary-Khamis dollars), the more
customer-delighting and agile-managed companies are, the more likely they will be to
attract and retain customers and beat competitors for an existing or new industry.

This is a special time in the history of humanity – we are just entering the
Innovation Revolution, the landscape of exponential organizations
[ExponentialOrgs], what the WEF callas the “4h Industrial Revolution”
[4thIndustrualRevolution] where:
companies reach 1 Billion dollar valuations in record times each year,
innovation is rampant in every industry, and customers are more powerful than
ever.

CONFIG

In this section is where we specify the parameters to configure our instance of
Enterprise Scrum. We won’t talk about all the parameters because they are too many.
Instead, we will pick up the ones that are most relevant to this instance.


Enterprise Scrum Team

Enterprise Scrum Team: Business Owner
The Business Owner for Startup Management is the person managing the entire
startup. This may or may not be the Business Owner of the Customer Segment Team,
which is in charge of the business direction of the startup based on customer feedback
and technical constraints, but it typically is.

The Business Owner owns the final decision on what gets done in the startup, and what
gets delivered as a business solution. The Business Owner therefore must know what
is MVP (minimal viable product), or even better MLP (minimum likeable product).

Because the Business Owner is a role, it can be distributed among more than one
person. But, just like in Scrum, if there are problems making expedient decisions, go
back to the single person implementation.



Enterprise Scrum Team: Coaches
If we are doing Scrum or Enterprise Scrum we need a ScrumMaster to guide us through
the Scrum process. However, in this instance the ScrumMaster is overseeing the entire
Enterprise Scrum implementation that the startup uses.

Enterprise Scrum Team: Team
Startup team or a new Business Unit team in an established company. This team could
be made of sub teams or not. A typical arrangement is a business team and a product
development team, but some many startups just have one cross-functional team.

We proposed in the Company Management chapter to call this team the Customer
Segment Team, that mirrors the customer. This works for both established companies
and startups, because both must do “all at once” business management, that is a single
group of people:
   • decide business strategy
   • does marketing
   • sells the product or service

© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved        70                                   st
                                                     Agile Management for the 21 Century
    •   develop and improve the product or service
    •   gets customer feedback and adjusts things as needed
    •   etc.

As companies grow, this pattern allows companies to keep the agility of a startup, and
avoid the tar pits of functional management. In the 21st Century, everything should be
treated on a “trial basis”, whether they are new or existing: business units, customer
segments, and products and services.

Startups may or may not have a separate product development team. Also, and
depending on the nature and size of the technical work, there could be several technical
teams working together in scaled mode.


Customer
The idea that we “develop the customers” is the a idea: when you are in a NEW Blue
Ocean market, you may not know exactly who your customers are! This is what Steve
Blank calls Customer Development – the finding or identification of who your customers
really are. So in startups or innovative business units within Blue Ocean markets, we
are trying to find the customers, as well as the solution, marketing, channels, etc. This
is what we call all-at-once management, and it’s a key ingredient of Agile Management,
as we saw in the Business Agility chapter.

Startups typically have a single product or service but they may have one or more
customer segments interacting and/or served in the business model. For example, a
financial institution has retail, high-net work, and institutional investors, so each one of
these classes of investors is a Customer Segment. A social network or a search
engine, or in general a” multi-sided business”, has two or more customers, for example,
the users and the advertising companies.


Customer: Business Value
In a startup, Business Value changes as the startup (or new business unit) evolves.

Within the search phase Business Value is:
   - finding a customer
   - finding a product or service is a value proposition for a customer
   - finding a business model
   - visits
   - users
   - cohorts e.g. conversions from visits to registered users, or from registered users
       to paid customers, etc.
   - employee happiness
   - customer satisfaction
   - finding an MTP
   - fail faster: fail as fast as you can. it is better to fail with 1-million-dollar

                                                        Agile Management for the 21 Century
        investment than with a 100-million-dollar investment!
    -   etc.

In the growth phase Business Value changes - a balance of:
    - attaining profitability (profit, revenue)
    - growing a product or service
    - faster time to market: better time-to-market means larger market share
    - growing market share (100% if it is a truly a Blue Ocean)
    - faster validation: not every idea is a “good idea”
    - more efficient development: the NPE of startups and brand teams is super high,
       compared to what it costs in a traditional Sloan-managed organization
    - faster decision making – instead of passing things from one functional
       department to the next
    - etc.

In the execution phase Business Value is:
    - stability
    - repeatability
    - massive scalability
    - massive profitability
    - etc.


Information Architecture: Canvas
Fortunately, we have derived already a few canvases, including one for a Business
Model. It was inspired, of course, by Alex Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas, but
we have reorganized it and added a few more things to coevolve, including the
Customer, the Team, the Business Owner and the Coach.




                            Figure 19. Enterprise Scrum Business Model Canvas


© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved                 72                                    st
                                                               Agile Management for the 21 Century
Information Architecture: Principal VLI
In a startup, the principal value list item, is that of the value proposition. For example, n
a software product, these are the features of the product.


Information Architecture: DORStandard
Conditions to start implementing VLIs for different VLI types. For example, a
DORStandard for a startup management, would be to have all VLIs defined, prioritized
and sized. However, for a startup, in Enterprise Scrum we size in both effort and
dollars.


Information Architecture: DODStandard
Conditions to get VLIs DONE. For example, for:
   - features of a software product: acceptance tests, unit tests, performance and
      load tests, etc.
   - hiring: completion of interviews, selection, offer, and sign employee
   - etc.

Knowledge - techniques, patterns
There are very many business management techniques that we can use for startup
management:
   • Customer Development [Blank]
   • Lean Startup- pivoting [LeanStartup]
   • Business Model Canvas - BMC, VPD [BusinessModelGeneration]
   • Blue Ocean Strategy - Strategic Canvas, ERRC [BlueOcean]
   • Exponential Organizations - MTP [ExponentialOrganizations]
   • Design Thinking [DesignThinking]
   • Profit Zone – Profit Patterns [ProftZone], [ProfitPatterns].
   • Scenario Planning – Scenarios [ScenarioPlanning],
   • Red Ocean Strategy – competitive analysis, 5-force analysis [Porter1], [Porter2]
   • Beyond Budgeting – rolling budgets [BeyondBudgeting].
   • StoryBoarding
   • Customer Journey
   • User Story Mapping
   • Customer Experience Design
   • Etc.

Process: Cycles
Short-term Cycles: 1-4 week cycles
Business Cycles: monthly, quarterly


Process: Optional Activities
We could do one or more of these activities:


© Mike Beedle, All Rights Reserved           73                                   st
                                                        Agile Management for the 21 Century
    -   find a Blue Ocean opportunity based on the analysis of factors in the market
        using the Strategy Canvas. Remember what we say in the startup community:
        there are “riches in niches” [BlueOcean]. This is typically done before the
        mandatory activities but can be adjusted at Refinement in a Cycle.
    -   If possible, find an MTP [ExponentialOrganizations]
    -   Observe the customer to determine pains, gains or jobs using Design Thinking
        techniques [DesignThinking]. This is typically done before the mandatory
        activities but can be adjusted at Refinement in a Cycle.
    -   Design our value proposition VPD (value proposition design). This is typically
        done before the mandatory activities but can be adjusted at Refinement in a
        Cycle.
    -   Build an initial business model using the BMC (business model canvas) from
        BMG (business model generation), or use our own ESBMC (Enterprise Scrum
        Business Model Canvas). This is typically done before the mandatory activities
        but can be adjusted at Refinement in a Cycle.
    -   Release Planning – forecast budgets and schedules for multiple smaller Cycles.
        This is typically done after the mandatory activities but can be adjusted at
        Refinement in a Cycle.


Metrics
For a startup, we will choose to measure:
CX customer experience
EX employee experience
$ cash on the books
V velocity of effort done per Cycle
Reports
Enterprise Scrum ScrumBoard

Notice how we left out a Cycle Burndown (Sprint Burndown). In Enterprise Scrum we
don’t require such constraint.

Calculations, Plans and Forecasts
We will require 2 reports:
   1) Effort Release Burndown – to show how much effort our team is capable of
   2) Cash on the books Release Burndown - to show how much money we have left



INSTANCE

To use an instance of Enterprise Scrum is very easy: simply use the appropriate
canvas for the activity, in this case Startup Management, and then evolve it through the
ES – ScrumBoard. The Enterprise Scrum – ScrumBoard has the entire process so it is
easy to see what to do: Vision, Initial Value List, Cycles.

                                                                Agile Management for the 21 Century
startup or business unit in a new Blue Ocean market through all phases: search,
growth, execution. This is the WHAT. For example, our startup could be a NEW travel
agency that allows you to register your trips in advance to compare flight prices over
time before you buy to optimize your purchases, which either buys a ticket or alerts you
based on rules that depend on pricing.

Also, it is ideal If at this point you can identify a strong Purpose – the WHY we are doing
this and how this contributes to the world. If people in the project believe in the WHY,
then you have something very special. You are not only seeking profit, but meaning
and purpose.

We fill the Vision/Purpose box of the ScrumBoard and optionally we can leave a large
copy of this vision and purpose always hanging on top of the ES – ScrumBoard. That is
a reminder to everyone of WHAT we are doing and WHY.

Here is a sample vision and purpose for our travel agency:


                  Vision:                                     Purpose:
      To build the most flexible and                 To allow everyone to travel
       cost efficient on-line travel                  more and get to know the
                  agency                                world and its people



Initial Value List

The list of things to do to get to accomplish our vision, which in this case is to MVP, and
then grow the travel agency to be a repeatable and scalable business.


Define
Here we define that we need to do to start our startup. We need to:
- experiment to validate things
- observing potential customers to see if there are pains, gains or jobs
- seeking for funding
- finding partners
- developing relationships
- identifying suppliers
- building value proposition
- hire team 2 team members

So let’s write an specific list of things to do to accomplish all of this:

Notice there is no priority, or size in either effort or cost at this point. We simply define
what we need to do, without worrying about the priorities. Don’t worry if you missed
something on the first go – we can always make corrections.

All of these VLIs above have a corresponding box in the Business Model Canvas as
shown in the following picture. The different color squares represent post-its -- “things to
do” in each VLIType – in each of the boxes in the canvas, which represent the VLIType
categories listed above.

When do we know when to stop: when the Business Owner determines we have
enough features to go “live” with the startup.

Prioritize
This is where the business-related features get prioritized. All of them must be
prioritized since we need to know which ones need to be implemented first. However,
there are 3 exceptions, since in Enterprise Scrum there are some things that may not be
prioritized: repeatable VLIs, unselectable VLIs, or scheduled VLIs.

We prioritize, or order by priority, all of the post-its in the canvas. Let’s do this:

 Meet with accountant to set accounting system.      Suppliers        S2


In addition, we made the metrics and recalculations “repeatable VLIs”, which are also
both collections:
VLI R1 – Measure: collection: {CX, EX, V, $}
VLI R2 – Calculate: collection: { Effort Release Burndown, Money Release Burndown }

Because these 2 VLIs are Repeatable, they will be done in every Cycle, and then
repeated for each and every Cycle, dropping the results of the reports or calculations to
the Done Canvas. Because both of them are Collection VLIs, both includes not one,
but several pieces of work.

Let’s also assume there are also a scheduled event to meet with the lawyer and the
accountant:
VLI S1 – Meet with lawyer to decide on company type. Falls in Cycle 1.
VLI S2 – Meet with accountant to set accounting system. Falls in Cycle 3.

These 2 VLIs will only be pulled into the Cycle if the dates coincides with the dates
covered by the Cycle.

Also, it is a good idea to categorize the Value List as “must haves”, “want to haves”, and
“nice to haves” to ensure we work on the ones absolutely needed to go live, and later on
the ones that are just added as optional ones (want to haves and nice to haves).

Now our Canvas looks like this:

                               Figure 23. Enterprise Scrum - BMC prioritized.

Size
For a startup, both time and money are important, so we should give size to both effort
and cost. To make things easier, we will use “weeks of work” for effort, and dollars for
costs. In Enterprise Scrum, the only people allowed to give size in effort, as in Scrum,
are the people doing the work.

 system.


Now, we are ready to start getting some work done!




                     Figure 24. Enterprise Scrum – BMC sized with both effort and cost.




CYCLES

Each and every Cycle we do work that has Business Value. In the large picture we:

    1) Cycle to search for a viable business model
    2) Cycle for initial growth
    3) Cycle for scalability and profitability, and even
    4) Cycle to phase out if things are not working out.




                                     Figure 25. Startup Timeline



In more detail, we cycle so that we can:
   - Validate the customer and the problem
   - Validate the solution
   - Validate the product features
   - Validate the marketing messages, campaigns and channels
   - Validate our cost structure
   - Validate our revenue generation and profit assumptions
   - Etc.

Everything gets co-evolved together as we continue to experiment.

Customer-validation might include:
  - cohorts - conversions from browsing to buying, for example)
  - average order size
  - customer lifetime value
  - average time to first order
  - rate of sales pipeline growth
  - improvement in close rate

    -   etc.

Each startup is different, so these metrics have to be chosen carefully.

In addition to the startup metrics above, the relatively few financial metrics that a startup
board should be tracking are:
    - cash-burn rate
    - number of months’ worth of cash left
    - short-term hiring plans

Each Cycle builds more of the business model, but the business model gets adapted in
each Cycle based on the feedback from:
   1) potential or better actual users or customers
   2) technology constraints or findings
   3) market changes
   4) team limitations or capabilities
   5) etc.

We keep iterating in Cycles with Enterprise Scrum before, while and after we release
an MVP to the market, or even better an MLP (most likeable product). We keep testing
everything on the canvas, and based on the results determine to do either small
tweaks, major tweaks or stop the project.

For example, for our travel agency, we need to show that …
   1) That purchasing plane tickets at high-prices is in fact a problem worth solving
   2) That there is a market for customers that want to save money by pre-registering
      their trips
   3) That such an application, including the rule engine that tests for conditions can
      be built, and that it will perform adequately
   4) That there aren’t any competing solutions that will erode the market for our
      offering
   5) That our team – the people currently hired, has in fact the talent to get feedback
      from the market and can in fact build a solution to solve the problem
   6) etc.


At this point our ES – ScrumBoard looks like this:

Cycle - PCRI



Planning
Plan which sections of the business model will be DONE in that Cycle. The
team(s), 1) choose which VLIs to implement, 2) makes a tentative plan to
accomplish this (optional)

From a workflow perspective, here we are moving the post-its from the “not
selected” canvas, to the WIP column.

For our travel agency, let’s assume that we have a team of 5 people, including
everyone in the startup team, and that there is not an official Business Owner or
Coach. Because in Enterprise Scrum these are roles, they can be distributed
among different people. If the startup at some point has problems making
decisions, then a person will be appointed as either Business Owner or Coach.
But this shows you an example, of an organization where these roles are
distributed.

Let’s also assume that our team will take priorities 1-4, plus the repeatable and
schedule VLIs that fall into this Cycle. As usual, the Enterprise Scrum team pulls

work into the Cycle. This is very important, as forcing people to take more work
than they feel comfortable is NEVER a good idea. Also, all of the VLIs must
have one or more volunteers to do the work, but note that in Enterprise Scrum,
Cycle Planning part 2 is optional – we don’t need to have a meeting for people to
make their own plans. However, if it is a new team, it is probably a good idea to
start them with Cycle Planning part 2.

After we complete the Planning session, all the selected VLIs get moved into the
WIP column.

At this point our ES – ScrumBoard looks like this:

Collaboration
At collaboration, we are working together to do everything that we chose in the
planning. Therefore, we are getting things DONE according to their DOD. For
us to call it Enterprise Scrum, we nee to integrate and test all of the work from
everyone in the team to find where we really are. Also, we need to collaborate,
cooperate, and share knowledge with everyone in the team at all times. Once
we find out where we are, we use our Daily Scrums to kick self-organization as
usual. We strongly recommend working in an Open Workspace environment.

From a workflow perspective, work remains in the WIP column until we get our
VLIs to pass DOD as we finish the Cycle.

Let’s assume that we got everything DONE, except VLI 4:

From an effort perspective, we accomplished 6 weeks of completed work that passed
their DOD. Therefore, our effort velocity is 6 weeks for that Cycle.

From the cost perspective, we spent $82, 500 that’s our burn rate for this Cycle.

We don’t have customers yet, so CX (measured as NPS), is “not measured”.

Our current employees reported an EX (measured as EPS), as 9.5 (average of all
scores).


Review
At Review, we are going to review what we accomplished in the Cycle, and where we
are cumulatively. However, a noticeable difference is that when we “grow startups”, we
don’t review, improve and refine the product or service only, we review and improve
EVERYTHING on the canvas: the product and service, the business model, the
marketing and sales, the growth hack strategy, the team, the vision, the customer
service, etc.

From a workflow perspective, we are now moving what we got DONE to the DONE
canvas on the right.

For our travel agency startup, we will review all these items – hopefully with some
evidence that we did in fact the work:

Notice how we not only demonstrate, show and review the VLIs that we did, but we can
review the rest of canvas just in case something important is going on.




After we finish the Cycle, our ES – BMC looks like this:




                                     Figure 28. ES - BMC DONE



And our ES – ScrumBoard now looks like this:

Improve

When we improve things, we are also at liberty to choose everything that we deem
important to improve: anything on the canvas! For example, we could improve the
business model, marketing, sales, the value proposition, the customer assumptions, the
financing, the customer service, or the team. ANYTHING one the canvas!

For our travel agency startup, after we talked to the customers, they provide feedback
that they needed a “travelling report”. Also, from the feedback from the developers, we
need to improve our infrastructure.

However, one of our “repeatable VLIs”, R3:

R3 - Calculate: collection: { Effort Release Burndown, Money Release Burndown }

Is a collection of calculations for the generation of the effort and cost forecasts. Since
we have measured both our effort velocity and our cost velocity, we can make
projections on both effort and cost.

The following formula applies to both time and money:

        Cw = VL/V

This is how many cycles it will take to finish the work.

        Cc = Total Cash Available/BR

This is how many cycles our money will last, assuming there is not a replenishment.

For example, if we have 100 weeks of work, and we know we can accomplish 10 weeks
of work in a Cycle, we can produce a schedule:

        C = 68 weeks of work/6 weeks/Cycle = 12 Cycles




                                     Figure 30. ES Release Burndown of Effort



However, we should check if the money is compatible with this schedule. Assuming we
have $1M left after some fixed costs, and that we spend $80K per Cycle, we can afford:

        C = $1M/82.5K ~ 12 Cycles.

                                     Figure 31. ES Release Burndown of Cash

So we should be ok, but barely, we will either need to make profits or get funding along
the way.

Notice the “Must Haves” on effort may have a different percentage than the “Must
Haves” on cost.
