If democracy were a matter of rational decision-making, there would be absolutely no reason to give all people equal voting rights – or perhaps any voting rights. There is ample evidence that some people are far more knowledgeable and rational than others, certainly when it comes to specific economic and political questions. — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0767FS76G&location=1036) ^ref-28041

When trying to outline their identity, people often make a grocery list of common traits. That’s a mistake. They would fare much better if they made a list of common conflicts and dilemmas. — location: [1939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0767FS76G&location=1939) ^ref-59396

In the twenty-first century, nations find themselves in the same situation as the old tribes: they are no longer the right framework to manage the most important challenges of the age. — location: [2240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0767FS76G&location=2240) ^ref-2076

Scientists too know how to cut corners and twist the evidence, but in the end, the mark of science is the willingness to admit failure and try a different tack. That’s why scientists gradually learn how to grow better crops and make better medicines, whereas priests and gurus learn only how to make better excuses. — location: [2297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0767FS76G&location=2297) ^ref-20681

So in the twenty-first century religions don’t bring rain, they don’t cure illnesses, they don’t build bombs – but they do get to determine who are ‘us’ and who are ‘them’, who we should cure and who we should bomb. — location: [2366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0767FS76G&location=2366) ^ref-20737

Monotheists, in contrast, believed that their God was the only god, and that He demanded universal obedience. Consequently, as Christianity and Islam spread around the world, so did the incidence of crusades, jihads, inquisitions and religious discrimination.11 — location: [3189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0767FS76G&location=3189) ^ref-36218

We hope to find meaning by fitting ourselves into some ready-made story about the universe, but according to the liberal interpretation of the world, the truth is exactly the opposite.
