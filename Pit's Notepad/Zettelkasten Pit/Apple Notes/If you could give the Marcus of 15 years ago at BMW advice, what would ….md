That's why I'm such a LeSS fan.  You start small and grow into the big.  You then have to get rid of the veneer to see what's underneath and rid the organization of dependencies. That's another downside of SAFe -  getting big too quickly, and you don't just want to manage the dependencies but get rid of them. So I want to choose architectures that decouple the dependencies from the systems.  https://info.seibert-media.net/display/AGILEHIVE/Scaled+Agile+at+BMW+-+An+interview+with+Marcus+Raitner+on+LeSS+and+SAFe
