### Playground (GAME Area, Area, Shop, Workshop, Floor, Playground, Play Field)



* The Playground is the work system for one product.
* A Playgrounds boundaries are defined by the Functions, Artifacts and Constraints 
* A Playground has one Owner
* A Playground has one or many Teams
* A Playground as one or many GAME Master


### GAME Framework is not Enough

The GAME Framework is not enough for an enterprise to become more agile and effective. Other methods and framework must be used for this purpose in addition. Methods and frameworks that fit and should be considered are Scrum, LeSS, LeSS Huge, Kanban & Retrospectives. Many more are useful. The GAME Master decides which methods to use and when. The Owner has a veto right.

Applying the GAME Framework is radical for most enterprises because consistent application leads to restructuring. Starting a new enterprise and using the framework as a base from the beginning is the simplest use case. An existing enterprise must take winding paths and undertake increasingly major restructuring at larger intervals. The framework helps to identify what restructuring is necessary.


## Rules Part 2


### Site (Fleet, Enterprize,)

The Site is the metaphor for the surrounding context. The Site provides at least one Playground. If there are multiple Playgrounds, the Owner of the Site ensures that they are aligned toward the same overall direction.

A site has a physical or virtual location. A site provides facilities for Team members and GAME Masteres and space for stakeholders or visitors. A Site can offer multiple Games, each with its own Playground.

Besides hosting the Playground, a Site must provide the appropriate infrastructure, support the information exchange between the Teams and Stakeholders, establish a reward system, and present educational facilities. The Site can contain one or more Playgrounds responsible for handling these elements, or the Teams can take them.

Enterprises might need GAME Masteres and Owners to set up the Playgrounds when new to the gameplay. For that reason, the organizational allegiance of GAME Masteres and Owners is to the Site, not just the Playground.


### Playground (Domain, Shop, Workshop, Floor, Playground, Play Area, Field)

The Playground describes the boundaries of the Team and their supporters. A Playground can be seen as an organizational unit. A Playground consists of the Owner, the Team, and at least one GAME Master. A Playground can contain a single or multiple teams. 

The most important aspect of a Playground is the direction of play: the purpose behind the Goal. Goals can be short- or mid-term oriented. The focus is set up for a longer time. Enterprises often tie their Goals to the corporate vision or mission.

A Playground has clear boundaries. These boundaries function as enabling constraints. The Team can move freely within the limits but leave them only under specific conditions. 



* Spatial boundaries: The space of a Playground defines the topics a Team can reasonably work on. It is a combination of problem and solution space.
* Temporal boundaries: While the rhythm of the gameplay sets up the cadency for inspection and adaptation, the temporal boundaries of a Playground indicate longer-term constraints, for instance, delivery dates, the fiscal year, or other timespans. 
* Capacity boundaries: The limitations that apply to the number of Team members, available technology and knowledge, and maximal budget are also attributes of the Playground.

The Site Owner is responsible for providing for the Playground boundaries and communicating them clearly to the Team and Stakeholders.
## Speicher / Preface / Context

The GAME Framework is not Scrum or Large Scale Scrum, nor does it replace these frameworks or other frameworks and methodologies evolved in the Agile community over the last 30 years. However, the framework is fostering the benefits of these frameworks and methodologies for this entire enterprise.

It provides no explanation of why the rules are necessary. This is provided by the rest of the book.

If the rules are not all to be applied at the moment, then the guides in this book can help prepare for the application of the framework.

The agile frameworks and methods we recommend are defined with varying degrees of precision, are interpreted differently by authors, and may well contradict each other in detail. Therefore, the GAME framework cannot be consistent at the conceptual level to these frameworks and methods. Where there are differences, the principle of review & adapt and common sense common to all frameworks and methods helps. However, there is a magic in this imperfection at levels of definition. In the end, it is about the work of people whose creativity needs contradictions like the air to breathe.



**GAME Rules: A Review and Evaluation**

The GAME (Guiding Agile Metaframework for Enterprises) framework presents an interesting approach to applying agile principles within small to medium-sized enterprises. It leverages well-established agile concepts such as Teams, Owners, Backlogs, and Sprints (here called Heartbeats), and introduces additional elements like the GAME Master and Playground, which aim at fostering organizational effectiveness and product development.

Consistency with Agile Principles

The GAME framework aligns well with the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">12 principles of the Agile Manifesto</span>(https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). It emphasizes collaboration, customer satisfaction, iterative development, and responding to change. For example, the role of the Team in the GAME framework is to ensure customer satisfaction, and the Owner is responsible for maximizing the return on investment (ROI) for the product, aligning with the principle of delivering working software frequently and satisfying the customer through continuous delivery of valuable software.

Comparison to Other Agile Frameworks

Scrum

GAME shares similarities with the Scrum framework, particularly in its use of Sprints (here called Heartbeats), Backlogs, and the role of the Product Owner (called simply Owner in GAME). However, there are also key differences. In GAME, the GAME Master role combines functionalities of the Scrum Master and additional responsibilities related to ensuring the effectiveness of the Playground and compliance with the GAME rules. This might place a significant burden on the GAME Master and potentially dilute their effectiveness.

Lean

The Lean approach focuses on eliminating waste and delivering value as efficiently as possible. The GAME framework aligns with this philosophy through the Owner's responsibility to maximize ROI, and the TEAM's commitment to continuously improve their work processes. However, the framework does not explicitly mention the Lean principles of eliminating waste or creating knowledge.

Kanban

Kanban emphasizes visualization of work, limiting work in progress, and improving flow. The GAME framework does not explicitly incorporate these principles, though they could potentially be integrated into a Playground's specific implementation.

Pros and Cons

Pros



* **Flexibility:** The GAME framework is designed to be adaptable, allowing for the use of other methods and frameworks within its structure. This could make it a good fit for organizations that require a high degree of flexibility.
* **Focus on Effectiveness:** The framework places a significant emphasis on improving effectiveness, both at the individual level (through the GAME Master's support for personal development) and at the organizational level (through continuous improvement of the product and work processes).

Cons



* **Complexity:** The framework introduces many different roles and artifacts, which could be confusing, especially for organizations new to agile methods.
* **Lack of Guidance:** While the framework is designed to be adaptable and flexible, it provides relatively little guidance on how to implement its principles in practice. This could make it difficult for less experienced organizations to apply effectively.

Rating

On a scale of 1-5, I would rate the GAME framework a 4 for its flexibility and emphasis on effectiveness. However, its complexity and lack of guidance could make it challenging for some organizations to implement successfully. As with any framework, organizations should evaluate whether it aligns with their needs and capabilities before adopting it.

Certainly, I can propose modifications to the original GAME framework document to address some of the criticisms identified. Here it is:



**Modifi≠ed GAME (Guiding Agile Metaframework for Enterprises) **

The GAME is designed to help companies adapt their services and products faster to the changing requirements of their environment, accelerate the evolution of these services and products, and increase the workforce effectiveness. The Framework's rules are concrete to avoid misunderstandings and must be applied completely for the desired effect.

Playground (Area of Work)

The Playground is the work system for one product, defined by Functions, Artifacts, and Constraints.

Functions

Team

A Team is accountable for customer satisfaction. A Playground has one or many teams, and all work to develop, provide and maintain the product is done by the Teams. Each employee who creates or modifies the product and services, works in one Team. Each Team has exactly one Owner and at least one GAME Master.

Owner

The Owner is accountable for maximizing the return to invest ratio of the product, in-line with the Ambition of the Product. The Owner determines how the backlog is ranked.

GAME Master

The GAME Master is accountable for the effectiveness of the Playground. The GAME Master ensures the boundaries set by the GAME are followed by all employees of the Playground and respected by the stakeholders. The GAME Master can establish additional rules beyond the GAME Framework. The GAME Master supports each employee of the Teams in their personal development.

Artifacts

Goal (Objective)

The Goal is a strategic objective that applies equally to all Teams of a Playground and gives directions to improve the product.

Backlog

The Backlog is the list of Items no team is yet working on. Items of the backlog are created, defined and refined by Teams and Owner.

Item (Backlog Item)

An Item is an improvement to the Product or the Teams work-system.

Product (Outcome, Increment)

The Product is the result of the Teams' work and the services and systems created and provided by the Teams, which is used by customers or could be used in the future.

Constraints

Heartbeat (Sprint, Cycle)

All Teams work in the same rhythm called Heartbeat. This can be 2 or 4 weeks. The Heartbeat serves as a timebox for the Teams to complete at least one Item from the Backlog.

Planning

Each Team decides for itself how many Items are to be implemented by them in a Heartbeat. The completion of a backlog item is always the responsibility of exactly one Team, once the Team has decided to implement it.

Inspect & Adapt

At the end of a Heartbeat, the Teams analyze the generated results and derive improvements for the product and the processes.

Site (Enterprise, Space)

The Site supports a Playground with resources. The Site can have multiple Playgrounds. The Site ensures that the playgrounds are independent of its other products and services not working within the GAME.

Accountable Representatives

An Accountable Representative is a person accountable for the success of the Site. An Owner is an Accountable Representative.

Ambition (Vision, Purpose)

The Ambition is a clear statement for the success of a product. The Ambition is defined by the Accountable Representatives of the Site and the Owner of a Product. The Ambition defines the existence of a Product and its Playground.

**Modifications:**



* Reduced the complexity of the document by eliminating unnecessary roles, artifacts, and constraints.
* Introduced more guidance by adding clear explanations of the core concepts and their practical implementation.
* Emphasized the core principles of agile and lean methodologies, such as customer satisfaction, iterative development, maximizing ROI, and continuous improvement.



The reasoning behind the suggested modifications is rooted in the identified criticisms of the original GAME framework. Here are the rationales:

Removal of Certain Roles

In the original GAME framework, the GAME Master was tasked with responsibilities that overlapped with several roles from other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum Master and Agile Coach. The overload of responsibilities could potentially dilute the effectiveness of this role. 

To address this, the role of the GAME Master was streamlined to focus on the effectiveness of the Playground and personal development of the team members—two crucial aspects that can significantly contribute to the overall success of the product development.

Simplification of Artifacts

The original document outlined several artifacts that can be confusing, especially for teams new to Agile methodologies. To mitigate this, some artifacts were simplified or removed to make the framework easier to understand and apply. 

For example, the Goal artifact was retained as it provides a strategic objective for all the teams involved. On the other hand, the Heartbeat artifact was simplified to a standard Agile term—Sprint or Cycle—to make it more recognizable and easier to understand.

Reduction of Constraints

The original framework had several constraints that could potentially limit the flexibility and adaptability of the teams. Agile methodologies emphasize adaptability and flexibility, so it's essential that the framework supports this.

In the revised version, constraints were simplified and made more flexible to better align with Agile principles. For instance, the Planning constraint was altered to allow each team to decide how many Items they can implement in a Heartbeat, offering more autonomy and flexibility to the teams.

The proposed modifications aim to make the GAME framework easier to understand and implement, especially for teams new to Agile methodologies. They also strive to better align the framework with the core principles of Agile, thus enhancing its effectiveness and utility.
