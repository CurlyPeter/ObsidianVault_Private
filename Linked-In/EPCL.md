# EPCL
ðŸŒŸ Let's talk about Empirical Product Control Loops or short EPCLs and why they're essential in today's dynamic business environments!

I coined the term because it encapsulates a familiar pattern of loops found in numerous methods, frameworks, and organizations. Here are some examples of EPCLs you might recognize:

ðŸ”¹ OODA Loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act  
ðŸ”¹ PDCA Cycle: Plan, Do, Check, Act  
ðŸ”¹ Wardley Mapping (): Leadership, Purpose, Landscape, Climate, Doctrine  
ðŸ”¹ eXtreme Programming (): Red, green, refactor  
ðŸ”¹ Lean Start-up (): Build-Measure-Learn  
ðŸ”¹ Cynefin Framework (): Probe-Sense-Respond  
ðŸ”¹ Scrum (): Transparency, Inspecting, Adapting, with time-boxing and early, frequent delivery. Seen in Sprints and Daily Scrums.

EPCLs are like the secret sauce in many organizational models, methods, and frameworks. They're all about optimizing the result or products of a complex social system.

I consciously noticed the loops when I first delved into Scrum 2004. The term originates from Empirical Process Control, which Ken Schwaber used to explain the principles of Scrum, drawing inspiration from the book "Process Dynamics, Modeling, and Control." But in my view, it's more about enhancing the outcome or product rather than solely focusing on the process that creates it.
