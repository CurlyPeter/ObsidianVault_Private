<span style="font-size:24pt;color:#000ff;"><b>Writing Objectives Using Bloom's Taxonomy</b></span>


<span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">Various researchers have summarized how to use Bloom’s Taxonomy. Following are four interpretations that you can use as guides in helping to write objectives using Bloom’s Taxonomy.</span>
<span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">From:</span> <a href="http://www.kcmetro.cc.mo.us/longview/ctac/blooms.htm" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank" style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#dca0dff;"><u>KC Metro</u></a> <span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">[old link, no longer functioning?]</span>
<span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">Bloom’s Taxonomy divides the way people learn into three domains. One of these is the cognitive domain, which emphasizes intellectual outcomes. This domain is further divided into categories or levels. The key words used and the type of questions asked may aid in the establishment and encouragement of critical thinking, especially in the higher levels.</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">LEVEL	LEVEL ATTRIBUTES	KEYWORDS	QUESTIONS</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">1: KNOWLEDGE</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Exhibits previously learned material by recalling facts, terms, basic concepts and answers.	who, what, why, when, omit, where, which, choose, find, how, define, label, show, spell, list, match, name, relate, tell, recall, select	What is ...?

<span style="color:#fffefeff;">2: COMPREHENSION</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Demonstrating understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions and stating main ideas.	compare, contrast, demonstrate, interpret, explain, extend, illustrate, infer, outline, relate, rephrase, translate, summarize, show, classify	How would you classify the type of ...?

<span style="color:#fffefeff;">4: ANALYSIS</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Examining and breaking information into parts by identifying motives or causes; making inferences and finding evidence to support generalizations.	analyze, categorize, classify, compare, contrast, discover, dissect, divide, examine, inspect, simplify, survey, take part in, test for, distinguish, list, distinction, theme, relationships, function, motive, inference, assumption, conclusion	What are the parts or features of ...?

<span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">According to Benjamin Bloom, and his colleagues, there are six levels of cognition:</span>
1. <span style="color:#262626ff;">Knowledge: rote memorization, recognition, or recall of facts</span>
2. <span style="color:#262626ff;">Comprehension: understanding what the facts mean</span>
3. <span style="color:#262626ff;">Application: correct use of the facts, rules, or ideas</span>
4. <span style="color:#262626ff;">Analysis: breaking down information into component parts</span>
5. <span style="color:#262626ff;">Synthesis: combination of facts, ideas, or information to make a new whole</span>
6. <span style="color:#262626ff;">Evaluation: judging or forming an opinion about the information or situation</span>
<span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">Ideally, each of these levels should be covered in each course and, thus, at least one objective should be written for each level. Depending on the nature of the course, a few of these levels may need to be given more emphasis than the others.</span>
<span style="font-family:ArialMT;color:#262626ff;">Below are examples of objectives written for each level of Bloom’s Taxonomy and activities and assessment tools based on those objectives. Common key verbs used in drafting objectives are also listed for each level.</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">LEVEL	LEVEL ATTRIBUTES	KEYWORDS	EXAMPLE OBJECTIVE	EXAMPLE ACTIVITY	EXAMPLE ASSESSMENT</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">1: KNOWLEDGE</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Rote memorization, recognition, or recall of facts.	list, recite, define, name, match, quote, recall, identify, label, recognize	“By the end of this course, the student will be able to recite Newton’s three laws of motion.”	Have students group up and perform simple experiments to the class showing how one of the laws of motion works.	Use the following question on an exam or homework. “Recite Newton’s three laws of motion.”</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">2: COMPREHENSION</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Understanding what the facts mean.	describe, explain, paraphrase, restate, give original examples of, summarize, interpret, discuss	“By the end of this course, the student will be able to explain Newton’s three laws of motion in his/her own words.”	Group students into pairs and have each pair think of words that describe motion. After a few minutes, ask pairs to volunteer some of their descriptions and write these descriptions on the board.	Assign the students to write a simple essay that explains what Newton’s laws of motion mean in his/her own words.</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">3: APPLICATION</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Correct use of the facts, rules, or ideas.	calculate, predict, apply, solve, illustrate, use, demonstrate, determine, model	“By the end of this course, the student will be able to calculate the kinetic energy of a projectile.”	After presenting the kinetic energy equation in class, have the students pair off for just a few minutes and practice using it so that they feel comfortable with it before being assessed.	On a test, define a projectile and ask the students to “Calculate the kinetic energy of the projectile.”</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">4: ANALYSIS</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Breaking down information into component parts.	classify, outline, break down, categorize, analyze, diagram, illustrate	“By the end of this course, the student will be able to differentiate between potential and kinetic energy.”	Present the students with different situations involving energy and ask the students to categorize the energy as either kinetic or potential then have them explain in detail why they categorized it the way they did, thus breaking down what exactly makes up kinetic and potential energy.	Give the students an assignment that asks them outline the basic principles of kinetic and potential energy. Ask them to point out the differences between the two as well as how they are related.</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">5: SYNTHESIS</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Combining parts to make a new whole.	design, formulate, build, invent, create, compose, generate, derive, modify, develop	By the end of this section of the course, the student will be able to design an original homework problem dealing with the principle of conservation of energy.”	Tie each lecture or discussion to the previous lectures or discussions before it, thus helping the students assemble all the discreet classroom sessions into a unified topic or theory.	Give the students a project in which they must design an original homework problem dealing with the principle of conservation of energy.</span>
<span style="color:#fffefeff;">6: EVALUATION</span>	<span style="color:#000ff;">Judging the value or worth of information or ideas.	choose, support, relate, determine, defend, judge, grade, compare, contrast, argue, justify, support, convince, select, evaluate	“By the end of the course, the student will be able to determine whether using conservation of energy or conservation of momentum would be more appropriate forsolving a dynamics problem.”	Have different groups of students solve the same problem using different methods, then have each group present the pros and cons of the method they chose.	On a test, describe a dynamic system and ask the students which method they would use to solve the problem and why.</span>
