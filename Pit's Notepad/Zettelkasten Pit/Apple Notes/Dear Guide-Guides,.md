I’m happy to hear that such a fine group is working together. As you guys, I care much about our education and certificate system. I like to offer you 3 observations of flaws in our system you may like to consider:  

- No customer is interested in the difference between the guide-level certifications. They don’t care if coaching or training or something else is the right thing to do. They want the guy with the best possible experience to get advice in order to lower the risk of an Agile transformation. Thus we should only have one guide-level certification. And no - we don’t need a guide-guide certification. See the other flaws.
- Scrum has 3 leadership roles. These roles are the model for Agile Leadership. For me the main purpose of the ScrumAlliance is to spread Scrum, its fundamental idea and its potential to change the wold of work. Therefore the fundamental design decision for the SA education path is role based. With all it advantages und disadvantages. CAL does not fit in this system.
	- It is devaluing Scrum to a team-approach. I as manger have to avoid it or it will harm my carrier.
	- It is stabilizing the existing management-system in the organizations we want to change with the Scrum-roles.
	- CAL is confusing customers and defocusing the ScrumAlliance members (trainer, staff etc.)
- We have way to much certifications. People don’t remember more than 5. Maybe 7 are acceptable. Even most of our team-member at DST are confused and are not able to explain each certificate.


Many people put a lot of energy in the education path and I’m sure they did it with their best intention. The 3 flaws are the result of very well know dysfunctions in large systems. E.g. lac of global optimization and lac of focus. My wish to you guys is not fixing this 3 flaws or others immediately. Instead find the flaws in the system developing our educations path and make changes here. My ultimate acceptance test for this guide-guide-system: It can radically constrain and keep constraining the further development of our education and certification system with rules like „One new certification in, 2 old certification must out“. 

May the Scrum values with you!

- People do not know in which role they should gather there experience as Agile Leader on the beginning. The education path is missing a point for orientation (like in german school system).
