[**Continuous Improvement Towards Perfection - Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)**](https://less.works/less/principles/continuous-improvement-towards-perfection.html)
What is perfection? There isn’t exactly a correct answer, but for example:
	•	the features are perfect, and profoundly delight customers; your product is awesomely popular and profitable
	•	you can create these features easily free of defects with almost no effort or cost
	•	your organization has agility; it can easily change direction with almost no friction or cost—can turn on a dime for dime
	•	your employees have extraordinary breadth and depth of skill and knowledge, and truly enjoy the work
