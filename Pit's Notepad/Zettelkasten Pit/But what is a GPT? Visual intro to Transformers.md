"But what is a GPT? Visual intro to Transformers" is a comprehensive guide to understanding Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and their underlying mechanisms. The content explains the concept of transformers, a type of neural network model used in various applications like text generation and machine translation. It delves into the process of tokenization, attention blocks, and the role of embedding and unembedding matrices in transforming input data into meaningful predictions. The guide also covers the importance of deep learning in machine learning and the significance of softmax functions in creating probability distributions.
