#### Definition:
@david thank you for sharing your insights. And @andy for bringing that up. We both had a discussion about this now for quite a while. However, I learned from you to look at the definition of the words. Thankfully, I found in the Cambridge online dictionary a definition for the term Framework in the context of organisations: framework: (1) a supporting structure around which something can be built

(2) a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide something (3) the ideas, information, and principles that form the structure of an organization or plan

I love davids definition and we should add to the list:

A collection of rules, principles and methods with a high level of coherence which form a structure for an organization to improve it.

I love davids definition and we should add to the list:

A really valuable collection of methods with a high level of coherence

So the definition is quite broad and seems to evolve in the context of organizations. Not so for method: “a particular way of doing something”. No wonder, most people struggle with the idea that a framework must be incomplete. Or rather, that the gaps between the structures need to be filled. I wonder if this should be a quality of a good framework: it contains measures, rules or methods to improve its own adaptation/fitting. What is your opinion?

BTW: this quality is what I miss most with S*Fe

David Snowden:
OED: "2. theoretical framework, n. A basic conceptual structure underlying a system, study, etc."  
  
American Heritage: "4. A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality."  
  
None of those cover a collection of methods and the OED definition suits Scrum and most Agile approaches to a tee: "More generally: a way of doing anything, esp. according to a defined and regular plan; a mode of procedure in any activity, business, etc. "  
  
I was not proposing "A really valuable collection of methods with a high level of coherence" as a framework. It would be silly to say we can add to the dictionary definition during a LinkedIn discussion - Humpty Dumpty again.  
  
A framework in application may entail methods and&generate models coherent with reality. Frameworks can also generate the need for methods & collections of methods. But if you make a collection of methods into a Framework, it prostitutes the language & creates Framework Wars. We need multi-vendor, multi-method approaches that allow contextual application. Scrum is well-placed to be a significant part of that.  
  
Measurements & the like apply to models and methods more than frameworks which work at a higher level of abstraction.
