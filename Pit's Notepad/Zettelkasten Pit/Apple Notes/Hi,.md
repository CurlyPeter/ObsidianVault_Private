Thanks to Aki und his fellows from Odd-e, I‘m happy to have the opportunity to revisit Tokyo. Talking to you guys was impressive last time and I‘m wondering if you like to do something again.

1. I can give another talk/workshop for the community. A topic I currently working with is Wardley Mapping. Something I think would also be precious for Groove X: „how to refine strategy for product and organizational development with Wardley Mapping.“ Here the abstract: https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvseuqef3r4mb8e/Wrokshop%20Wardley%20Mapping%20%28en%29.txt?dl=0
2. I’m still want to write an article about how you work at Groove X. For that it would be wonderful to meet with people to I can discuss some questions:
	1. How are the teams structured
	2. How do you deal with the dependencies between teams
	3. How do you integrate the product?
	4. How do you test the product?
	5. How do you integrate development and production?
	6. Who is and how are they continuously developing the product strategy
Would it be possible to revisiting you and to have some time to interview some people? @Aki are interred to do this together and we write the article together?

here the time I would be available:

13th

all-day:

Looking forward to meeting you guys again!
