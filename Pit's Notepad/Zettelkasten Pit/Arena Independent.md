An Arena must operate as independently as possible. If an Arena depends on others, it should only do so through well-defined interfaces. If these interfaces are not provided, the priority should be to establish such interfaces. If this is not feasible due to complexity requiring continuous interface changes, then maintaining a larger Arena with its combined Product is the better choice.
