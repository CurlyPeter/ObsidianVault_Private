# The New New Product 
# What is the product anyway.
What is the product anyway? A deeper understanding of the product helps to adapt LeSS. Let's discuss a model.
# 2025 will be the year when LeSS takes off – here's why I think so

# Agile is not dead. Agile Transformation are dead. Actually they never were alive.

Let's prepare and make it happen. 

## Why are Agile Transformation failing?
- let's take this oprtunity
- The Term Agile died long ago. but the need for Agile remains. Reason: Evolution. Example AI
- Scrum, LeSS & GAME3 don't need a Transformation. They are the Tranformation. Continouly.
- We need evidence. At least oberservations.
- Axiom: Overall Empericim for the entire enterprise, not only for a development group.
- Huge Investments in Agile Transitons are drawn back. Ergo:  Shareholder, the true owners are unhappy
- 
1. we need a explain the reason of the bad investemnt
	1. concrete oberservation of bad investment (people, time, ...) to return (outcome, services, ...)
	2. Root cause analysis
	3. How do it different. 
	4. Experiments.
	5. How to measure. What different can we observe
	6. audience: Shareholder
3. We explain how to it better

## Dear Shareholder, Enterprise Owners & Board members:
Agile, Scrum or SAFe Transitions are not saving your investment. A Transition or Transformation project primarily serves to SAFe your management's career and sustain the consultancy businesses.

Scrum & LeSS **don't** need an Agile Transitions and Transformations. They **are** an ever continuing transition. They simply keep our organization flexible. Because your product and service need to adapt to the every, faster changing marketing condition. We call that evolution.

Scrum and LeSS is not enough for an enterprise. Your Investment as Shareholder is not just money. Your investment must be leading because you are in power. Yes, ownership is leadership with power. You are part of the game!

Playing the game is simple:
Create a strategy focused on the evolution of your product, services, and organization. Lead by making you part of an observe, experiment, measure loop and adapt your strategy continuously.

## Dear Agile Coaches & Consultants.
Agile is not dead. Agile means: the ability to respond. Enterprises are forced to optimize their ability to respond to the ever-changing marked conditions. Forever. This is the logical conclusion of evolution. In a complex situation, as markets are, trusting empirical control is the best strategy to evolve. 

We Agilst know that. We brought Plan, execute, inspect and adapat to teams and business. The heartbeat for the evolution of product and services. **Empirical-based Evolution** at its best.

However, the term “Agile” with a capital "A“ has become overused and has lost its meaning. We are not innocent. We have used the term for nearly everything what is important to use. From Agile Requirements Engineering to Agile wool knitting. We were happy to join large Agile Transitions enjoing the warm flow of money.

But Agile don't need transitions or transformation projects. Scrum, LeSS and Kanban are the every continuing transformation. Because the Evolution of our Enterprises never stops.

So, let's call what we do **Empirical-based Evolution**. And let's make it better than last time.
