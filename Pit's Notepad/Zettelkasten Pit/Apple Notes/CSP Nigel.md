**Join me and my good friend Nigel Baker on our first two-day Scrum Mastery (CSP-SM) training course in London in 2023! Deepen your theoretical and practical experience of the servant-leadership and coaching role that is the ScrumMaster.**
Nigel & I are two of the leading Scrum thinkers in the world. Having started our agile journeys helping lead one of the biggest agile transformations at British Telecom back in 2001, we have since helped companies across the world get the most out of Scrum. As well as our obvious agile backgrounds, we also have other skills such as presentation skills, improvisational theatre and sports coaching that we weave into our work to help teams and organisations grow and develop.
This Certified Scrum Professional course is aimed at those in a servant-leadership and coaching role who are looking for a deeper level of enabling, facilitation and coaching skills.
