The 5 Question you like to ask the participants bevor your Retrospektive privately:
- What has to happen, that this retrospective is a success for you?
- What topic you like to discuss in the retrospective?
- Have you a topic you don’t like to be discussed?
- What topics is the team maybe avoiding to address?
- Who can help solving issues and should attend?
