## Highlights
The role of finance is to transform savers’ quests for security and liquidity into the entrepreneur’s necessarily long-term illiquidity and acceptance of risk. If banks and other institutions don’t perform this role, economic growth flags and stagnation sets in. — location: [1395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B072NYKG2G&location=1395) ^ref-40607

The blind spot of AI is that consciousness does not emerge from thought; it is the source of it. — location: [1545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B072NYKG2G&location=1545) ^ref-37371

“A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography” (1945) proved that a perfect randomized one-time pad constitutes an unbreakable code, a singularity. The theory of information deals with a continuum between white noise (purely random) and perfect order (predictable and information-free). Shannon’s paper focused attention on the fertile domains of redundancy in between, which he dubbed “stochastic.” — location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B072NYKG2G&location=1636) ^ref-26633

monolith, the predictable carriers of the blockchain underneath, and metaverse, the inventive and surprising operations of its users above. They would provide the foundation for a creative cornucopia. — location: [2518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B072NYKG2G&location=2518) ^ref-52271

Adding a technological argument to Coase, Clayton Christensen shows that integration—essentially bundling components together in a seamless system—is desirable as long as a technology falls short of a market need. All interfaces between components must be optimized to the point that the market need is satisfied. Then, where suboptimal performance satisfies the market, modularity—using standardized interfaces and components—will reduce costs and expand market share.2 — location: [3708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B072NYKG2G&location=3708) ^ref-12298
