<span style="color:#000ff;">Dear CSTs,</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">I've been following the conversations about Scaling and other advanced training with great interest, and I'd like to weigh in with some help and clarification. I'll be doing this in the context of "The Scrum Alliance Enhanced Program Architecture," a flexible model that will allow us to add new education programs with ease.   I'll will  describe this in more detail below.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">This is a lengthy communication – I apologize for that!</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">First, some important things to note:</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>Key points regarding your role as a CST</b></span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">Your current CST agreement with Scrum Alliance prohibits your teaching courses with organizations that offer certifications that compete with CSM, CSPO, and/or CSD certifications.</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">On 12/24/13, I communicated to the CST community "Currently, we do not consider PMI-ACP or SAFe to be competing Scrum Certifications."</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">To that end,  you can teach SAFe or any similar course as an Extended Education course that in turn offer a student SEUs toward their CSP certification.</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">We are reviewing the language of the CST and all agreements on a regular basis so that they keep up with the times and do not have unintended or undesirable impacts.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>We want you to teach advanced material</b></span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">Scrum Alliance can only grow and thrive if we are seen as a strong source for more than just introductory level certifications. If we have a presence only at the core "intro" level, members would come in one door and go out the other just as fast.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">For a while, the core was nearly all we did. That's no longer true. Our conferences, events, and coaching are all about going beyond the core. In particular, the CSP, our “beyond the core” certification, is granted only to individuals with three years of Scrum experience and a demonstrated dedication to continued learning.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">You, our training community, are our main source for the continued learning that our members depend on.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>We are helping you address advanced topics</b></span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">The CSP certification is becoming more and more recognized as the Scrum Alliance certification to get. Part of that is, of course, due to you telling your students about it and our increased marketing efforts. As it grows in popularity, CSP creates more and more demand for advanced material, and Scrum Alliance provides you a marketplace in which to offer that material.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">In addition, we sponsored and supported the creation of a set of Learning Objectives for Scaling (attached for your review). The work, of course, was done by some of the most experienced members of the training community. Almost all of Scrum Alliance's knowledge and understanding of Scrum comes from you. We know that. You're the experts; we are here to support you, to support our members, and to keep the lights on.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>We want to help you more</b></span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">We want to help you help our members with advanced learning materials and courses. We are glad to spend time and money to do this, and we understand that creating advanced Scrum Alliance materials is very important.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Some CSTs have called for creation of a group from the training community to build Scrum Alliance materials about Scaling and perhaps other topics.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">As mentioned, we are willing to support these types of efforts with time and money. We'll want to see it done in true Scrum style.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">There are also valuable Scaling materials out there already: LeSS, Enterprise Scrum, Scrum at Scale, SAFe, and more</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">In support of advanced learning, and for your use, we are more than willing to negotiate agreements with the owners of these materials so they will be available to you through Scrum Alliance.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">The owners of these materials want to be sure that those who use them are well prepared. They typically require their trainers to attend classes, and in some cases to pass tests, to be sure they're ready to do the job.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We are happy to support our CSTs in undertaking this learning. We will look favorably at ideas that will minimize the costs of taking this training.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>We really do want to help you</b></span>
 

<span style="color:#000ff;">It is critical to Scrum Alliance's future to have a wide range of learning offered through Scrum Alliance.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We sincerely believe that it is in our mutual best interests to build a membership that is hungry for knowledge, a training community that can provide that knowledge, and a revenue model that keeps things going.</span>



<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>What does the Enhanced Program Architecture mean to us?</b></span>

 

<span style="color:#000ff;"><b><i>Remember our purpose:</i></b></span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;"><b><i>Transform the world of work by guiding organizations to become prosperous and sustainable, to inspire people, and to create value for society.</i></b></span>

<span style="color:#000ff;"><i>This is not just some hollow corporate mission; it is the idea that informs everything we do. Helping people learn and succeed is how we carry out our purpose.</i></span>



<span style="color:#000ff;">As mentioned above, we cannot prosper if all we were to offer were core-level certifications. We need to offer more, and we have started to do that.</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Our CSP certification is intended to be "the certification of the Scrum Professional”: the one to get. It requires not just a few courses but real experience, plus a demonstration of continuous learning. It measures that learning through the simple mechanism of SEUs, or Scrum Education Units. Today, an SEU equates to an hour of learning, and as members of our training community, your courses and mentoring can provide an almost unlimited number of SEUs to CSP candidates. Other sources are all much more limited. You have a strong advantage in serving this need.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We do offer other learning resources at Scrum Alliance. Our Gatherings and events, user groups and other supported conference sponsorships, website articles, the Agile Atlas -- they are all evidence that Scrum Alliance is there to help its members.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Frankly, we need to do this. If our members are going to be successful, we need to encourage them to continue their journey and provide them with learning opportunities and a place to learn and talk about Scrum. We need to retain them, for our own financial good and for the industry benefit we are here to provide.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>Certifications, Additional Qualifications</b></span>
 

<span style="color:#000ff;">We're well aware of the advantage that a "certification" gives in selling education. We are the poster child for organizations that have succeeded using this approach.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We must be careful, however. If we offer too many certifications, they'll quickly become meaningless, and we may devalue our own product. Yet if we offer too few, we make it harder to sell what we have.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">The CSP certification is gaining more recognition in the marketplace, but it's not there yet. We're reluctant to add more, fearing that would confuse our market and slow our progress.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">There's another consideration to offering something like a "certification in Scaling." Scaling is huge. It is difficult. It requires months, even years, of work to help an organization scale, and it requires real skill and experience on the part of those who are helping organizations transform.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We cannot put people through a few days of training and then "certify" them in Scaling. We fear that with such minimal training, they'll likely not be successful, and the certification will lose its value.</span>



<span style="color:#000ff;">Our response to that is to promote a members’ core-level certification to a “+” certification, after taking an "Added Qualification" course and assessment.</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">What we mean by that is:</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">CSM or CSPO is identified as a prerequisite to most Added Qualification courses, such as Scaling. By taking a course and assessment in Scaling, a member would get a CSM+ (or CSPO+) with an Added Qualification in Scaling and receive a Scaling Certificate. The same would be true for members taking other “Added Qualification” courses (once available) that require a core-level certification as a prerequisite.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">It's clear that to become a real expert at Scaling, one might need a number of qualifications.  There could be, for example, AQs (Added Qualifications) in:</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* ScrumMaster service in the large organization</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Team-level Product Ownership in the large organization</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Development skills for the large organization</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Leading Scrum developers in the large organization</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Group-level Product Ownership ...</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Portfolio management ...</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Managing Work in process across the large organization ...</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">To really succeed at "Scaling," people in the organization need to have many of these qualifications. Perhaps no one needs them all, but most everyone needs more than one, and quite likely everyone needs one or two.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">This is a huge opportunity for all of us. We want to create an Enhanced Program Architecture providing learning offerings that:</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Are of real value, covering important learning objectives thoroughly</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Are sought after and are easy to sell</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Can be presented by as many members of our training community as possible</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">* Return suitable financial rewards to our training community and to Scrum Alliance</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;"><b>Next steps</b></span>
 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Attached is our current document describing the Enhanced Program Architecture. This is in our current release and the first iteration. (It is potentially shippable!) Quite frankly, this communication is past due. It was presented in Berlin at the coaches and trainers retreat; however, we understand that not everyone was there. You deserve to see this and to provide feedback.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We are scheduling a series of online conversations with you. We may have to limit attendance, or at least how many people can speak, just to keep the calls manageable. We'll have several, so that we can talk with and hear from as many as are interested. You will receive an invitation soon that will include a link to provide your feedback and to help us prepare appropriately.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We will have face-to-face conversations when and where we can, as we did in Berlin. Again, we want to hear from everyone and talk with everyone who is interested in providing feedback.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">We will continue to monitor our  forums, but we simply cannot respond actively in those venues. What we see there only confirms what we all know, that the closer to face-to-face we can be, the better we'll do.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Please know that we are very much in support of advanced topics, and we're glad to see the engagement and interest from our training community in developing advanced training materials. We are more than willing and absolutely intend to support those ideas as appropriate.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">I look forward to our conversations.</span>
