The confession of an Scrum Beliver on co-located work.

Maybe we are wrong about remote work

Just to make it clear: I have always sad, that a scrum team has to be collocates to become productive. Until today. I think I was wrong. More over, strikes preaching co-collocation as a key successfactor can harm a growing agile culture in an organization more than its benefits. As soon as I accept that, I more and more see examples that distributed teams can out-perform co-colocated teams. My (literally) (co-)own(ed) company is the best example. 
Experience Scrum People have a strong opinion about distributed Team since the early days of Agile. : Don‘t. It based in the experience of maybe thousand of Scrum Teams working on komplex products since the 90th. Interesting enough is, that the Agilemanifest is not speaking of collocates teams. Instead is values face-to-face conversation as fundamental for success:

Agile Manifesto: The most efficient and effective method of  conveying information to and within a development  team is face-to-face conversation.

True is that co-location naturally inherent this succesfactor. But face-to-face conversion can easily achieved in may domains with highly reliable online communication tools. Its seems that this is exactly where we maybe simplified the situation of a successful team to much in the past. Face-to-face communication is just one of many factors for success and those can easily achieved without co-location.

Face-to-face communication
Felling and touching the product increment
Tanzpartner what is going on in the team
Gossip talk I can listen to
Just go arround 
I can have fun my colleagues even after the ‚office time‘, but I don‘t need to

SW easer to implement


Now I hat shows you, that co-location is not necearly need to be succesfull. But what really rubbles me, is that co-location can be a drawback.

While I‘m writing this, I‘m sitting in Tokyo closes to die electric Town Arribaba and I listening (I know I don‘t should do that) to the conversation of 2 American expats in my nabout tabel: One of them complaint, that office time ist biggest productive killer he know. Especially in a culuter as in japan where following the detail oders ist still deeply empeded, he fells Staat office time is just implemented to control him. Is argument is simple: He can in 2h Starkbuck as productive as 1 day in the office.
Forthalft I could not follow more of the conversation, but my interpretation of the root problem was: He feels to be mistrusted und his Bereitschaft to take over responsibility for the greater goal of his work was zero. What a lost of creativity and power.
