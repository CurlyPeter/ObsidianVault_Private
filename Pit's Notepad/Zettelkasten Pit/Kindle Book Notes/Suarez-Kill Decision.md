## Highlights
“Which is why human society mostly works; people avoid trouble. But behind every law is the implicit threat of force, and behind every vote is the implicit threat of rebellion. That’s the bargain that holds a free society together. And no society with a wide power imbalance remains free for very long.” — location: [3130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0073XV2W2&location=3130) ^ref-7731
