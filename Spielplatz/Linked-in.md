🔍 Focusing on the Catalyst for Continuous Improvement: The Coach 🏆

In the ever-evolving landscape of modern business, effective leadership is not just a nice-to-have, it's a make-or-break. That's where GAME3, a progressive leadership framework, steps in. It empowers businesses to navigate the complexity and drive innovation through three fundamental functions: Owner, Coach, and Team. 🎯

In my latest article, I've explored how Coaches within GAME3 enhance effectiveness and adaptability, using two examples — a burgeoning Start-up and a medium-sized Enterprise. Here's a sneak peek:

🚀 The Start-up: From the get-go, this company adopted Scrum as its management system. As the organization grew, so did the number of Coaches, each dedicated to various focal points like facilitating the recruiting process, introducing and adapting engineering methods, and continuous coaching on product strategy.

🏢 The Medium-Sized Enterprise: Here, the CEO offered the Coach a continuous role to facilitate the process of inspecting and adapting the enterprise strategy, making him the Chief of Staff. His initial task was to align the existing board and executive meetings.

The Coaches, in both examples, have taken on the responsibility of optimizing the entire work system, which we call Arena in GAME3. 

In conclusion, Coaches lead to an effective work system in the Arena by:
✅ Developing competencies of Teams and people
✅ Facilitating decision-making
✅ Sustaining a continuous cycle of Planning, Execution, Inspection, and Adaptation.

Stay tuned for the next article in the series, where I will spotlight the Leadership role of the Teams.
