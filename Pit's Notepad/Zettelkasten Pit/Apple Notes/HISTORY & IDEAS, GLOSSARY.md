CONSENT VERSUS CONSENSUS
[21 JUNE 2007](http://www.sociocracy.info/consent-versus-consensus/) [SHARON VILLINES](http://www.sociocracy.info/author/sharon-villines/) [LEAVE A COMMENT](http://www.sociocracy.info/consent-versus-consensus/#respond)
The consent versus consensus discussion is largely one of emphasis. Sociocracy uses “consent” decision-making for all  [policy decisions](http://www.sociocracy.info/policy-decisions/). Consent is defined as “no objections.” Objections must be reasoned and paramount. Consent does not mean you fully agree, only that you will be able to work toward the aims of the decision, that you can “live with it.”
Consent is used to emphasize the difference between the traditional full-group consensus model and the delegated consensus model. In full-group consensus decision-making, all members of a group make all policy decisions. The origins of consensus decision-making are in the Quaker peace tradition and the civil rights movement where equality and non-oppression were prime values.
In Sociocracy, only those who are affected by a policy decision must consent to it being implemented, sometimes through an elected representative. It establishes a governance structure that allows delegation of decisions while preserving equivalence—something that was not understood previously.
Consent and reasoned and paramount objections are more acceptable in corporate and government agencies where the idea of consensus decision-making for business decisions is foreign. There are, however, more and more consultants advising that even in business contexts consensus decision-making produces superior results. One such book is [Larry Dressler](http://www.larrydressler.com/)‘s [Consensus Through Conversation](http://www.sociocracy.info/consent-versus-consensus/). Dressler works in some of the world’s largest corporations. The forward for his book is by the former CEO of Mitsubishi Motors.
