The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. — location: [465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=465) ^ref-2400

There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=473) ^ref-35454

This network of artificial instincts is called ‘culture’. — location: [2535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2535) ^ref-52206

---
During the first half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that every culture was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging essence that defined it for all time. — location: [2535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2535) ^ref-11049

---
Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. — location: [2541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2541) ^ref-34976

---
Unlike the laws of physics, which are free of inconsistencies, every man-made order is packed with internal contradictions. Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions, and this process fuels change. — location: [2544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2544) ^ref-54659

---
But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture’s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. — location: [2571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2571) ^ref-5575

clear that history is moving relentlessly towards unity. The sectioning of Christianity and the collapse of the Mongol Empire are just speed bumps on history’s highway. — location: [2593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2593) ^ref-58153

Money was created many times in many places. Its development required no technological breakthroughs – it was a purely mental revolution. — location: [2757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2757) ^ref-37684

---
Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. — location: [2809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2809) ^ref-17321

---
money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised. — location: [2812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=2812) ^ref-25947

religion has been the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires. — location: [3254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3254) ^ref-38947

---
Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. — location: [3258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3258) ^ref-55914

---
religion must possess two further qualities. First, it must espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary. — location: [3266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3266) ^ref-48432

A leading theory about the origin of the gods argues that gods gained importance because they offered a solution to this problem. Gods such as the fertility goddess, the sky god and the god of medicine took centre stage when plants and animals lost their ability to speak, and the gods’ main role was to mediate between humans and the mute plants and animals. — location: [3291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3291) ^ref-60652

Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion. — location: [3476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3476) ^ref-4793

He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is. This law, known as dharma or dhamma, — location: [3527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3527) ^ref-20708

But in all frankness, how long can we maintain the wall separating the department of biology from the departments of law and political science? — location: [3673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3673) ^ref-40163

Chaotic systems come in two shapes. — location: [3729](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3729) ^ref-4391

---
The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. — location: [3730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3730) ^ref-27966

Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding off their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea – such as belief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth – can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them. — location: [3763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3763) ^ref-59779

---
This approach is sometimes called memetics. It assumes that, just as organic evolution is based on the replication of organic information units called ‘genes’, so cultural evolution is based on the replication of cultural information units called ‘memes’.1 — location: [3771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3771) ^ref-64049

Postmodernist thinkers speak about discourses — location: [3776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3776) ^ref-25096

---
a. The willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge. b. The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories. c. The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies. — location: [3870](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3870) ^ref-21552

---
The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions. — location: [3878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3878) ^ref-16211

---
All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods: a. Take a scientific theory, and in opposition to common scientific practices, declare that it is a final and absolute truth. This was the method used by Nazis (who claimed that their racial policies were the corollaries of biological facts) and Communists (who claimed that Marx and Lenin had divined absolute economic truths that could never be refuted). b. Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scientific absolute truth. This has been the strategy of liberal humanism, which is built on a dogmatic belief in the unique worth and rights of human beings – a doctrine which has embarrassingly little in common with the scientific study of Homo sapiens. — location: [3918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3918) ^ref-3182

fewer than 5,000 British officials, about 40,000–70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another 100,000 British business people, hangers-on, wives and children were sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians.9 — location: [4682](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4682) ^ref-24564

racism in imperial ideology has now been replaced by ‘culturism’. — location: [4730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4730) ^ref-31888

Mum and Dad are about as likely to be found innocent in the Freudian courtroom as were defendants in a Stalinist show trial. — location: [5658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5658) ^ref-13694

Like money, limited liability companies and human rights, nations and consumer tribes are inter-subjective realities. — location: [5676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5676) ^ref-56615

There is a positive feedback loop between all these four factors. The threat of nuclear holocaust fosters pacifism; when pacifism spreads, war recedes and trade flourishes; and trade increases both the profits of peace and the costs of war. — location: [5857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5857) ^ref-53366

When we try to guess or imagine how happy other people are now, or how people in the past were, we inevitably imagine ourselves in their shoes. But that won’t work because it pastes our expectations on to the material conditions of others. — location: [6001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6001) ^ref-33259

As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. — location: [6127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6127) ^ref-8930

The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. — location: [6141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6141) ^ref-10895

So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. — location: [6144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6144) ^ref-58097

‘What do we want to want?’ Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven’t given it enough thought. — location: [6520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6520) ^ref-48894

Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want? — location: [6537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6537) ^ref-25862
