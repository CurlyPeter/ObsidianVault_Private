## Highlights
At a basic level, a strategy is what you want to achieve and how you will get there. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=261) ^ref-58121

Interestingly, Herzberg asserts that compensation is a hygiene factor, not a motivator. — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=385) ^ref-4338

But all you can aspire to is that employees will not be mad at each other and the company because of compensation. — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=390) ^ref-7043

It was the building of it, and how they felt about their own contribution, that they found satisfying. I had thought the destination was what was important, but it turned out it was the journey. — location: [451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=451) ^ref-50516

deliberate strategy. The second source of options is unanticipated— — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=524) ^ref-58679

unanticipated opportunities and resolve unanticipated problems. When strategy forms in this way, it is known as emergent strategy. — location: [530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=530) ^ref-11159

In other words, strategy is not a discrete analytical event—something decided, say, in a meeting of top managers based on the best numbers and analysis available at the time. Rather, it is a continuous, diverse, and unruly process. Managing it is very hard—the deliberate strategy and the new emerging opportunities fight for resources. — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=537) ^ref-49993

There’s a tool that can help you test whether your deliberate strategy or a new emergent one will be a fruitful approach. It forces you to articulate what assumptions need to be proved true in order for the strategy to succeed. The academics who created this process, Ian MacMillan and Rita McGrath, called it “discovery-driven planning,” but it might be easier to think about it as “What has to prove true for this to work?” — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=614) ^ref-43554

Instead, ask the project teams to compile a list of all the assumptions that have been made in those initial projections. Then ask them: “Which of these assumptions need to prove true in order for us to realistically expect that these numbers will materialize?” — location: [656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006I1AE92&location=656) ^ref-7176
