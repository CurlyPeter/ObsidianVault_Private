Building reliable secure computing systems out of unreliable insecure components is a concept introduced by Butler Lampson, Martin Abadi, Michael Burrows, and Edward Wobber. It describes the process of designing systems that remain trustworthy and safe, even when some of their parts are faulty or vulnerable.

This approach uses techniques such as redundancy, error correction, and layered security. The goal is to ensure the overall system continues to function correctly and protect data, despite failures or attacks on individual components.

This concept is important for managers and leaders who want to build robust IT solutions in environments where perfect hardware or software cannot be guaranteed.
