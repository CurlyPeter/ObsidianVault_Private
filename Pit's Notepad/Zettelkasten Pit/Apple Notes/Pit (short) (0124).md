I was the product leader of the humanoid robot named Pepper Robot. It was actually developed by the French company named Aldebaran. I have learned a lot about robots at the time. I knew already a lot about automotive prodcuts. However, there is huge difference between cars and robots. What I get aware of is people get bored very quickly. So keep curiosity high. Keep people interested it's really difficult. So I learned that a product which is surviving in the market, is a product which is keeping peoples curiosity hight. For example games. The gaming industry has a lot of knowledge to keep deeper interest of the user in the prodcut. If we just simply make a robot cheer driven, people would get board in just five minutes. So keeping people's interest in the Lovot hight was the biggest issue for us. And actually, nowadays Lovot is probably the best product in the world not only for children, but also the adult, especially women and elder people. Because, it this his where Lovot is very strong today. People are getting crazy more and more of Lovot as soon they are using it. So this is - what I can say - I'm most proud of.
