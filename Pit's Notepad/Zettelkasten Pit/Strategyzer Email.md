## **How AI changed everything and nothing** 

Companies are racing to implement the latest AI tools. This is the right thing to do because there is no denying that Generative AI is transforming industries. Powerful Gen AI tools have impacted how we create value and solve complex problems. 

The rise of Gen AI has changed everything.  
  

However, a [recent MIT report](https://cbsfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/W0+113/cBsfv04/VX1n_27S4SlyW7yvK9s8GKRRYW7jDgJ35C1HS_N97h0G45nXHCW5BWr2F6lZ3m9W5jJScX1vG0MGW4F-1jq6tfFdCW3jntTJ4KWfRhW7l2sZW3xYrYxW6TLP-p2H8h-pW3mrBqY2xwHMBW1QHzmR7P4rRnW3MFwVT9jJrq4VyxQ_74HLlPGW2nHFHt1mrgVHVrflhK7yGYpRW8L8sVb6LTmjzVgyPjH5twZhVW7qjDVn2rFsg2V5Zb-M2mvwqyW5Gsns53ZHylkW60w8Tb6qh--mW54Xgdr13SHnhVs3wWG7PBw3WW2pgZNC8vZSprW6DQqj14yzjQqW45Xsgc1SJ6D6W1HD0SQ6Cl6ZdW8rPGtz3kn2VKW2wbKbc2QV4HBW8yQL3w1RGSrtW1626b92hSg52W4ZcZgx14GpTMVYBhnj4f21fJW1rfdrB3ZtDrTW2k3xlw98p35nW2jGGqD82z9B6W1Cb6V_1sFH2gN560Gy1LddkJf6JSb6d04) found that 95% of Gen AI pilots in companies are failing. Despite companies’ attempts to integrate these powerful tools, only 5% of AI pilot programs are succeeding. 

The underlying issue is not the quality of the AI models, but how and where they are being implemented within the organization. The real competitive advantage still lies in leaders understanding their business models and how to leverage AI to drive real value for their customers and organizations. 

In that sense, the rise of Gen AI has changed nothing.

We believe that the real winners of the Gen AI revolution will not be those with the flashiest LLMs and algorithms. The winners that will emerge are those with the strongest business models. 

Leaders need to understand the difference between the backstage of their business model where value is created (e.g. key activities and key resources), and the frontstage of their business model where value is delivered to customers (e.g. channels and relationships). 

A good approach is to pick specific pain points within the business model and then choose the right Gen AI tools to address those.
